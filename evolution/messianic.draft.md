# Messianic Era

The period following the resurrection of Jesus and the day of Pentecost marked a tumultuous time for his followers. Often referred to as the Messianic era, this first generation of disciples faced intense pressure and persecution as they navigated their identity within the Jewish community and the broader Roman Empire. This article explores the challenges faced by these early believers and how their faith spread despite opposition.

## Early Persecution in Jerusalem

Soon after Pentecost (Acts 2), the priests, temple leaders, and Sadducees started to persecute the Messianic believers. These followers preached in Jerusalem that Jesus (Acts 4:1-22) was the Messiah.

> And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. ... Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison. Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. — Acts 8:1,3-4 (ESV)

## Identification as "The Way"

This first generation of disciples often identified themselves as the Way. This name possibly came from the Messiah whom they followed, who initially identified himself as the way:

> "I am the way, and the truth, and the life." — John 14:6 (ESV)

It could also be a shortened version of "the way to salvation" (Acts 16:17).

## Expansion through Adversity

The Way was considered a sect (Acts 24:2-5) in those days by the Jewish authorities. Therefore, they bound and imprisoned both men and women (Acts 22:4-5). In some cases, believers were executed (Acts 7:57-59, 8:1). Paul, who was one of the persecutors, testified about his former life before his conversion:

> For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. — Galatians 1:13 (ESV)

Ironically, Paul failed to destroy the church. His actions instead helped to advance it to other regions in the Roman Empire:

> Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. — Acts 11:19-20 (ESV)

In this context, Hellenists refers to Greek-speaking people. These individuals often included Jews who had adopted Greek culture and language.

## Roman Involvement

The [Roman government](1st-c-roman-imperial-cult.md) also became involved with the persecution:

> About that time [Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church](https://readingacts.com/2013/02/19/acts-121-2-why-did-herod-kill-james/). He killed James the brother of John with the sword, and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. — Acts 12:1-3 (ESV)

This persecution made it difficult to establish public services. At this time, there were no dedicated church buildings like those used by modern Christians.

## Informal Gatherings

Instead of public buildings, the believers gathered [informally in private homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_church#Origins) (Acts 12:12). While some critics might suggest these gatherings were entirely public, the intense persecution often necessitated that they meet in secret. This practice of meeting in homes is further supported by other New Testament writings, such as the mention of the church that meets in the house of Prisca and Aquila (Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:19).

## Conclusion

The Messianic era was characterized by [early persecution in Jerusalem](#early-persecution-in-jerusalem) from religious leaders, which led the first disciples to identify themselves as followers of ["The Way."](#identification-as-the-way) Despite these challenges, the faith [expanded through adversity](#expansion-through-adversity) to other regions. This growth eventually brought [Roman involvement](#roman-involvement) in the persecutions, forcing believers into [informal gatherings](#informal-gatherings) in private homes to maintain their community and faith.
