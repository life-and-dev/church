# 1st Century BCE (Jesus)

## Chronology and the Calendar

Scholars disagree on the exact date of the birth of Jesus. Most agree it occurred near the transition of the Anno Domini year system. This system switches from BC era years to AD era years. Many Jews do not use this system. It starts counting from the birth of Jesus Christ, whom they rejected as the Messiah. Critics may argue that the Anno Domini system was only developed centuries later by Dionysius Exiguus. However, the system's focus on the birth of Christ remains the central point of contention for those who prefer the non-religious BCE and CE designations.

## Teachings of Jesus

While Jesus was alive, he taught and demonstrated moral standards to many disciples. Most of these followers were Jews. His teachings include several key elements. He provided fresh revelations on how to interpret the Mosaic laws. He focused on love and righteousness with God and one's neighbors. This was an alternative to merely obeying religious rituals.

> And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." — Matthew 22:37-40 (ESV)

Jesus also gave people a fresh perspective of the character of God. He explained God's plan and motives for humanity. His message included the revelation of the kingdom of God. He preached the gospel of salvation. This teaching suggested that people do not need priests and rituals to be saved. He also provided warnings and prophecies about the future.

## Trial and Crucifixion

These teachings caused a stir in the Jewish community. Jesus eventually received a death sentence for claiming to be the Christ. The Jewish priests considered this claim to be blasphemy. According to their law, blasphemy was punishable by death.

> But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God." Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven." Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death." — Matthew 26:63-66 (ESV)

Many scholars agree that Jesus was crucified around AD 30 to 33.
