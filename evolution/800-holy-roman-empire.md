# 800 (Holy Roman Empire)

How did a medieval alliance between a pope and a king reshape the map of Europe and the future of the Christian church? The emergence of the Holy Roman Empire marked a pivotal shift in power. It blended political ambition with religious authority in a way that would define Western civilization for centuries.

## Political Foundations

In 756, Pope Stephen II allied with the Frankish King, Pippin the Short. This alliance aimed to [gain independence from the Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Pepin). Through the Donation of Pepin, the king granted the papacy temporal authority over vast territories in central Italy. This act effectively established the Papal States. It provided the Roman Catholic Church with a secure land base and political autonomy.

This cooperation was seen as a fulfillment of the apostle Paul writing:

> Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. — Romans 13:1 (ESV)

The alliance ensured that the church had a powerful protector in the West. This protection was necessary as the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire began to fade in Italy.

However, Paul's words were implemented out of context:
1. The book of Romans is [not God's inspired word](https://word.ofgod.info/inspired) (a set of new divine commands). It was a letter of an apostle to advise the church of Rome (Romans 1:7).
2. Paul was addressing the persecuted church of Rome and advised them not to retaliate against the authorities (Romans 12:14-21).

This earthly power stood in contrast to the words of Jesus regarding his mission.

> Jesus answered, "[My kingdom](https://kingdom.ofgod.info) is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world." — John 18:36 (ESV)

## The Imperial Restoration

On 25 December 800, [the pope crowned Charlemagne, King of the Franks as emperor](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/the-coronation-of-800-ce/) of the Holy Roman Empire. The ceremony took place at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The goal was to reunite various regions of the [former Western Roman Empire](dark-ages.md) under a common rule. Charlemagne was the son of Pippin and continued the strong relationship with the papacy.

This coronation was more than just a political event. It restored the title of Emperor in the West after more than three centuries. It also created a "New Rome" that was distinct from the Byzantine East. The emperor became the secular defender of the faith. The pope remained the spiritual leader. This division of power became a central theme in medieval European politics.

## Impact on Western Christianity

The Holy Roman Empire lasted until 1806. [This was significant](https://www.medievalists.net/2010/12/the-significance-of-the-coronation-of-charlemagne/) for several reasons:

* It set a precedent for papal involvement in imperial politics. This strengthened the Roman Catholic Church's power.
* The empire helped suppress religious practices that went against the Roman Catholic Church. This included the forced conversion of various Germanic tribes.
* It facilitated the spread of Roman Catholic Christianity across Europe.

Critics often argue that the empire was primarily a political tool rather than a spiritual mission. They suggest that the blend of church and state corrupted the original message of the gospel. However, proponents at the time believed that a unified Christian empire was the best way to maintain peace and order. 

The legacy of the Holy Roman Empire continues to be debated. It remains a crucial chapter in the history of both church and state.

## The Papal Inquisition

The centralized power established by the Holy Roman Empire eventually led to more institutionalized forms of religious enforcement. In 1233, Pope Gregory IX established the [Papal Inquisition](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/papal-inquisition), a series of measures designed to actively seek out and prosecute heretics—anyone whose beliefs or practices disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church.

Unlike previous decentralized efforts, the Papal Inquisition was a centralized authority that used systematic methods to ensure conformity:
* **Torture:** In 1252, Pope Innocent IV issued the bull *Ad extirpanda*, which explicitly permitted the use of torture by inquisitors to extract confessions from those suspected of heresy.
* **Execution by Fire:** Those found guilty of heresy who refused to convert (recant) were "handed over to the secular arm" to be executed. The most common method was being burned at the stake, a practice that became a public exhibition of the state's power to enforce religious unity.
* **Loss of Rights:** Even those who converted often faced permanent imprisonment, confiscation of all property, and the loss of civil rights for themselves and their descendants.

This practice of using violence to destroy those who disagreed was explicitly rebuked by Jesus during his ministry (Luke 9:54-56). Jesus never authorized the use of physical force or torture to compel belief.

## Conclusion

The Holy Roman Empire emerged from a [strategic alliance](#political-foundations) between the papacy and the Frankish monarchy. It established the political foundations for the [Papal States](#political-foundations) and [restored the imperial title](#the-imperial-restoration) in the West. This union had a deep [impact on Western Christianity](#impact-on-western-christianity) by expanding the influence of the Roman Catholic Church.
