# Montanism

How did the early church decide what was true Christianity? The story of Montanism, a fiery prophetic movement from the second century, reveals the challenges early believers faced in defining their faith amidst claims of new revelations. This article explores the origins, beliefs, and ultimate rejection of this controversial group.

## The Origins of Montanism

Around 156 or 157 AD, [Montanus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Montanus-religious-leader) converted to Christianity in Ardabau, a small village in [Phrygia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Phrygia) in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) (modern Turkey), although some scholars date the start of his ministry as late as 177 AD. He fell into a trance and began to "prophesy under the influence of the Spirit" and was soon joined by two young women, Prisca (or Priscilla), and Maximilla, who also began to prophesy. They called themselves, "the Three". Montanus claimed to be [the embodiment of the "Spirit of the Truth"](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html), arguing that his revelations supplemented and perfected the teachings of the apostles. This was considered heretical by the mainstream Christian Church of that time.

## Core Tenets of Montanism

The teachings of [Montanism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism) centered on a number of strict ethical and disciplinary practices, including:
* **Legalistic Moral Rigorism**: The Montanists emphasised strict adherence to moral codes and taught that Christians should strive for a higher level of spiritual perfection.
* **Lengthened Fasting Times**: They advocated for longer and more frequent periods of fasting as a means of spiritual discipline.
* **Forbidding Flight from Martyrdom**: [The Montanists forbade fleeing from persecution](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm), believing that [Christians should eagerly accept martyrdom](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/why-were-the-montanists-condemned/). This stood in contrast with the orthodox teaching that permitted flight (Matthew 10:23).
* **Discouraging Marriage**: While not universally enforced, some Montanist leaders taught that celibacy was a higher spiritual state.
* **Prohibition on Second Marriages**: The Montanists prohibited remarriage after the death of a spouse or divorce, viewing it as a concession to worldly desires.

## The Church's Response and Lasting Influence

Although [Montanism gradually disappeared between the 5th and 9th centuries](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism), the church's struggle against it had a lasting impact. The controversy forced the church to formalize its understanding of apostolic authority and encouraged the canonization of Scripture to create a clear boundary between divine revelation and heretical claims. It also left a notable mark on influential figures like [Tertullian](/kingdom/church/history/tertullian), whose later writings were heavily shaped by Montanist asceticism.

## Conclusion

The rise and fall of Montanism marks a pivotal chapter in early church history. Its [origins in the prophecies of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla](#the-origins-of-montanism), its [strict ethical tenets](#core-tenets-of-montanism), and the [church's ultimate rejection of the movement](#the-churchs-response-and-lasting-influence) all played a crucial role in shaping the development of Christian orthodoxy.
