# Montanism

What happens when new prophetic voices emerge claiming to speak for God, centuries after the age of the apostles? In the 2nd century AD, a movement known as Montanism did just that, challenging the early church's understanding of authority, revelation, and spiritual life. This article explores the origins, core tenets, and the lasting, albeit controversial, impact of this prophetic revival.

## The Prophetic Outburst in Phrygia

In 156 AD, [Montanus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Montanus-religious-leader), a recent convert to Christianity in Ardabau, a village in [Phrygia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Phrygia) (modern Turkey), fell into a trance and began to prophesy. He was soon joined by two women, Prisca and Maximilla, who also professed to have the prophetic gift. Calling themselves "the Three," they claimed to be conduits for new revelations from the Holy Spirit. Montanus asserted that these prophecies, delivered through him as [the embodiment of the "Spirit of the Truth,"](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html) were authoritative and must be accepted by the church. This claim of new, ongoing revelation was a direct challenge to the established church leadership and was therefore considered heretical—a belief contrary to orthodox doctrine.

## Core Tenets

[Montanism taught](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism) a message of spiritual renewal that emphasized a return to a more rigorous and disciplined Christian life:
* **Strict Moral Rigorism:** The Montanists stressed unwavering adherence to strict moral codes, teaching that Christians should strive for a higher level of spiritual perfection.
* **Lengthened Fasting Times:** They advocated for longer and more frequent fasts as a way to discipline the body and demonstrate devotion to God.
* **Forbidding Flight from Martyrdom:** [The Montanists forbade fleeing from persecution,](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm) believing that [Christians should embrace martyrdom](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/why-were-the-montanists-condemned/) rather than escape it. [This view was considered unlawful](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html) by the mainstream church, which permitted flight based on teachings like Matthew 10:23.
* **Discouraging Marriage:** Some Montanist leaders taught that the celibate life was spiritually superior, which led some adherents to reject marriage and family.
* **Prohibition on Second Marriages:** The Montanists also prohibited remarriage after the death of a spouse or divorce, believing this maintained purity of heart and unwavering dedication to God.

## Legacy and Influence

Although [Montanism gradually disappeared between the 5th and 9th centuries](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism) after being formally condemned, it left a lasting mark on the church. The movement's teachings [influenced the theology of key figures like Tertullian,](/kingdom/church/history/tertullian) who was its most famous convert. The controversy also forced the early church to clarify its own doctrines on apostolic authority and the role of the Holy Spirit. In response to Montanism's claims of new revelation, the church accelerated the process of formalizing and closing the biblical canon to define a clear boundary between authoritative scripture and other writings.

## Conclusion

Montanism began as a [charismatic, prophetic revival in Phrygia](#the-prophetic-outburst-in-phrygia) led by Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla. The movement was defined by its [strict moral and ascetic practices,](#core-tenets) including an emphasis on fasting and an embrace of martyrdom. While ultimately condemned as a heresy for its claims of new, authoritative revelation, Montanism's challenge prompted the early church to solidify its own theological positions, contributing significantly to the [development of the biblical canon and church doctrine.](#legacy-and-influence)
