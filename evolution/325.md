# 325 AD (1st Nicaea Creed)

Around 318 AD, Arius from Alexandria began preaching his doctrine that Jesus, [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), was created by God and not eternally divine or of the same substance as God the Father. This view challenged Constantine's view that Jesus is God. This resulted in a split in the church which was referred to as [Arianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

Therefore, the church leaders gathered in 325 AD at [the council of Nicaea](https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/ancient-history/council-of-nicaea/) to prevent further church splits by:

* defining the divinity of Jesus;
* [condemning Arianism as heretical](https://www.rca.org/about/theology/creeds-and-confessions/the-nicene-creed/);
* establishing church hierarchy;
* separating Christian practices from Jewish traditions;

[The Emperor Constantine](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/history/constantine) actively participated in the proceedings, and 300 bishops and church leaders from across the Roman Empire attended.
 
One of the council's challenges was to determine how to consolidate the divinity of Jesus Christ with monotheism (belief in one God). The solution was to define [the concept of the Trinity](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity), which posits that God exists as three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) but is one being. This allowed Christians to maintain their monotheistic beliefs while also acknowledging the divinity of Jesus Christ. 
 
At that time the Trinity was already a familiar concept which was first used by Tertullian about a century earlier. However, Christians initially rejected his doctrine in fear of polytheism (worship of multiple gods). Therefore the council had to carefully and clearly define the Trinity to avoid misunderstandings. 
 
This led to the establishment of [the Nicene Creed](https://faculty.washington.edu/ewebb/Creeds.pdf), which declared:

> * We believe in [one God](https://son.ofgod.info/shema), [the father almighty](https://ofgod.info), [maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible](https://eternal.family.net.za/creation).
> * And in one [lord](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/lord), Jesus [the anointed](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/holy),
>   * the only begotten [son of God](https://son.ofgod.info),
>   * ***begotten of the father before all worlds***,
>   * [light from light](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light),
>   * ***[true God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god)*** from true God,
>   * ***begotten not made, being of one substance (homoousios) with the father*** (against [Ebionitism and Arianism](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/interpretations)),
>   * ***by whom [all things were made](https://eternal.family.net.za/creation)***.
>   * Who for us humans and for our [salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved) came down from heaven and was ***[incarnate](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation)*** by [the holy spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/spirit) and the virgin Mary (against [Docetism](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/interpretations)), and was made man, and
>   * was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.
>   * He suffered and was buried, and the third day [he rose again](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/resurrected) according to the scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the father.
>   * And [he shall come again to judge both the living and the dead](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/prophecies/jesus#second-coming).
>   * Whose kingdom shall have [no end](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/eternal).

Eusebius initially showed sympathy for Arius, but eventually decided to sign the Nicene Creed. The Council's outcomes included:

* **Defined [*the Holy Trinity*](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity)**
* **Declared [Jesus Christ as divine](https://son.ofgod.info/son-as-god)**
* **Declared [Jesus Christ was the same substance ("homoousios") as God the Father](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/essence/as-god/similarities)**
* **Declared anyone who believed Jesus was a created being a heretic**
* **Established the authority and jurisdictions of bishops within the Church hierarchy**
* **Christians should separate themselves from Jewish feasts**
* **Jewish passover had to be replaced with the Christian Easter**

This creed became the cornerstone of the Christian belief and continues to be recited in many modern Christian denominations during worship services.

Possible reasons for this declaration are:
* **Political unity**: Constantine wanted to unify the empire under one religion to strengthen his rule and reduce conflicts.
* **Theological clarity**: The early church sought to clarify its beliefs in response to various theological disputes and heresies.
* **Cultural integration**: By defining Christian beliefs in a way that resonated with existing pagan beliefs, the church aimed to facilitate the conversion of pagans to Christianity.

In 336 Arius died, potentially [poisoned by his opponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arius#Exile,_return,_and_death), others claim it was the result of "God's punishment for his heretical views".

> The history of Christian thought is filled with condemned positions — each one representing not just theological error, but the natural destination of common ways of thinking about how God can be both three and one.
>
> The catalog of Trinitarian heresies reads like a map of conceptual pitfalls:
>
> **Arianism** taught that Jesus was the first and greatest created being, but not fully God. The Council of Nicaea (325 AD) condemned this view, insisting that the Son is “begotten, not made” and shares the same divine essence as the Father.
>
> **Modalism** (also called Sabellianism) proposed that Father, Son, and Spirit are simply three modes or masks worn by one divine person — like an actor playing three roles. The church rejected this because it denied the distinct personhood of each member of the Trinity.
>
> **Subordinationism** held that the Son and Spirit are divine but somehow lesser than or subordinate to the Father in essence or nature. This was condemned as undermining the equality essential to orthodox Trinitarianism.
>
> **Tritheism** suggests there are three separate gods rather than one God in three persons. This crosses the line into polytheism and contradicts the fundamental Christian claim of monotheism.
>
> Yet even after Nicaea supposedly settled the question of Christ’s divinity in 325 AD, the doctrine remained incomplete and contested. The original Nicene Creed said almost nothing about the Holy Spirit — just a brief phrase: “And *[we believe]* in the Holy Spirit.” It took another half-century and the work of the Cappadocian Fathers — Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa — before the Spirit’s full divinity was officially recognized at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Even then, disputes persisted. The Western church later added the filioque clause, stating the Spirit proceeds from the Father “and the Son,” while the Eastern church rejected this addition.

## Defining Easter

[Constantine supported **the separation of the date of Easter from the Jewish Passover**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great_and_Judaism), stating in his letter after the First Council of Nicaea:

> "... it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul ... Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way." -- [Eusebius, Life of Constantine Vol. III Ch. XVIII Life of Constantine (Book III)](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm)

> The Council of Nicaea in 325 decreed that Easter should be observed on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox (March 21). Easter, therefore, can fall on any Sunday between March 22 and April 25. -- [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Easter-holiday)
