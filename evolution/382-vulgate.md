# 382 (Vulgate Bible)

Have you ever wondered how the Bible was preserved and transmitted through the centuries? For over a thousand years, one Latin translation stood as the authoritative text for Western Christianity. This article explores the history and impact of the Vulgate, a monumental work that shaped the language of faith for generations.

## The Need for a New Translation

At the time [the Gospels](https://word.ofgod.info/books) was written, [the Jews used Koine Greek, especially in the Septuagint, to communicate with Gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Koine_Greek). [Koine Greek was the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean following Alexander the Great's conquests.](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2015/09/gle398009) However, in the Western Roman Empire, Latin was the common tongue. As the Church grew, there was a growing need for a standardized and reliable Latin version of the Scriptures.

## Jerome's Monumental Task

Therefore, [in 382 AD, the Bible (Vulgate) was translated into Latin by St. Jerome](https://amazingbibletimeline.com/blog/vulgate-the-latin-bible/) on the recommendation of Pope Damascus I. [St. Jerome utilized sources such as the Vetus Latina, Hebrew texts, and the Greek Septuagint.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Jerome_to_Pope_Damasus) In addition, [he also translated the books of Judith and Tobit from Aramaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate). This collection of texts was called the ["Biblia Vulgata"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) (Bible in the common tongue).

## Theological Influences

St. Jerome was a staunch supporter of [Nicene orthodoxy](380-state-religion.md), which upheld [the doctrine of the Trinity](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity) and opposed [Arianism](337-arianism.md). Some scholars suggest that his theological commitments may have influenced his translation choices in theologically ambiguous passages.

## Legacy and Impact

This translation eventually became [the standard Latin version of the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate) for the Western churches where [Latin gradually became a prominent language](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/2015/09/gle398009) under Roman rule. Many early vernacular [translations](https://word.ofgod.info/translations), such as [the Wycliffe Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe) (the first Middle English translation) and the Douay-Rheims Bible, were directly based on the Vulgate. This English translation remained the standard for Roman Catholics until the 20th century. Likewise, many other modern Catholic Bible translations, including the Confraternity Bible (1941), Knox Bible (1945), Jerusalem Bible (1966), RSV-CE (1966), Nova Vulgata (1979), and NRSV-CE (1989), also used the Vulgate as a source.

## Conclusion

The Vulgate stands as a landmark in the history of biblical translation. It met [the need for a standardized Latin text](#the-need-for-a-new-translation) and was the result of [St. Jerome's meticulous work](#jeromes-monumental-task). While potentially shaped by [theological influences](#theological-influences) of its time, its [legacy and impact](#legacy-and-impact) on Western Christianity are undeniable, shaping centuries of theology and providing the foundation for countless translations.
