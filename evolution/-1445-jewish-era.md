# 1445 BC - 33 BCE (Jewish Era)

The Jewish Era laid the foundation for much of the modern world's spiritual and moral understanding. This period saw the emergence of the Tanakh, the establishment of the Temple priesthood, and the profound shift in religious practice that occurred with the life and teachings of Jesus. By examining these roots, we can better understand the transition from ancient tradition to the dawn of a new era.

## Origins of the Tanakh

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is the Book of Genesis. It is estimated to have been written between 1445 and 1405 BC by Moses. Since Moses, many authoritative judges, kings, and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) (Hebrew Bible). These books center on the history of Israel. They document how the nation came into existence, the fall of Israel, and how God maintained a remnant after the Babylonian exile. The [development of the Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible#Development) spanned several centuries. The scriptures also include important literature about God and His creation. They provide wisdom, principles, laws, and teachings. These prophecies, blessings, and songs remain very important to non-Jewish nations, including Christians in the modern era.

## The Apocrypha

Bible books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus the Christ are considered [Apocrypha](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apocrypha) by Protestant Christians. They do not accept the authority of these books and did not include them in their Bibles. However, the Catholic Church does accept these books as part of the biblical canon.

## The Divine Name

God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה. This name directly translates to the [Tetragrammaton](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tetragrammaton) YHVH. Sometime before the birth of Jesus, likely during the Second Temple era, the Jews replaced the name YHVH with Adonai. This word means "Lord" in English. The shift is also evident in Greek manuscripts where the Jews refer to God as "Lord".

> God spoke to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel: 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations." — Exodus 3:15 (ESV)

## Temple and Priesthood

The Tanakh describes how the Israelites refused to approach God directly. It also explains how the temple was built. A priestly and sacrificial system was introduced. This system was designed to cleanse people from their sin. It allowed them to maintain righteousness with God.

## Conclusion

The Jewish Era represents a period of significant development for the scriptures and religious practices that define the faith today. From the [Origins of the Tanakh](#origins-of-the-tanakh) and the preservation of the [Apocrypha](#the-apocrypha), to the transition of the [Divine Name](#the-divine-name), the era was marked by deep reverence for tradition.
