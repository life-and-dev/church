# Jewish Era

The Jewish Era laid the foundation for much of Western religious thought. This period saw the formation of the Hebrew Bible and the development of unique theological practices that continue to influence the world today.

## The Hebrew Bible

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is the Book of Genesis. Traditionally, scholars estimate it was written around 1445 to 1405 BC by Moses. This dating aligns with the biblical chronology found in 1 Kings 6:1 (ESV), which places the Exodus 480 years before the construction of Solomon's Temple.

Since the time of Moses, many authoritative judges, kings, and prophets contributed to the Tanakh, also known as the Hebrew Bible. These books chronicle the history of Israel. They describe the nation's origin, the fall of Israel, and how God maintained a remnant after the Babylonian exile. The Tanakh also includes literature about creation, wisdom, laws, and prophecies. These writings remain important to many nations and form the basis for Christian belief.

Books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus are considered Apocrypha by Protestant Christians. While Catholics accept these books, Protestants do not recognize their authority and exclude them from their Bibles.

## The Divine Name

God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה. This is known as the Tetragrammaton or YHVH. During the Second Temple era, a practice developed to avoid pronouncing this sacred name. Jews began replacing the name "YHVH" with "Adonai," which means "Lord."

> God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel: 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations." — Exodus 3:15 (ESV)

Greek manuscripts also reflect this practice. They often refer to God simply as "Lord" or *Kyrios*. This tradition of substitution has persisted into modern translations.

## The Birth of Jesus and the Calendar

Scholars disagree on the exact date of the birth of Jesus. However, most agree it occurred near the transition from the BC era to the AD era. The Anno Domini system counts years from the birth of Jesus Christ.

Many Jewish scholars prefer the use of BCE (Before Common Era) and CE (Common Era). This preference stems from the theological implications of the term *Anno Domini*, which means "Year of our Lord." Since the Jewish faith does not recognize Jesus as the Messiah or Lord, the use of neutral terminology is often preferred in Jewish and academic contexts.

## The Ministry of Jesus

In the Tanakh, the Israelites established a priestly and sacrificial system. This system was designed to cleanse people from sin and maintain a righteous standing with God.

During his life, Jesus taught and demonstrated new moral standards. His teachings included:

* Fresh interpretations of the Mosaic laws. He focused on love for God and neighbors rather than religious rituals.
* A new perspective on the character and plans of God.
* The revelation of the kingdom of God.
* The gospel of salvation. This teaching suggested that individuals could be saved without relying solely on priests and rituals.
* Warnings and prophecies about the future.

> And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." — Matthew 22:37-40 (ESV)

## The Crucifixion

The teachings of Jesus caused significant unrest in the Jewish community. He eventually received a death sentence for claiming to be the Christ. Jewish priests considered this claim to be blasphemy, which was punishable by death under their interpretation of the law.

Critics often debate whether claiming to be the Messiah constituted blasphemy. However, the Gospel accounts indicate that the religious leaders viewed his assertion of divine authority as a capital offense.

> And Jesus said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven." And the high priest tore his garments and said, "What further witnesses do we need? You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as deserving death. — Mark 14:62-64 (ESV)

Most scholars agree that Jesus was crucified around AD 30 to 33.

## Conclusion

The Jewish Era provided the essential framework for understanding God and His relationship with humanity. This period established the [Hebrew Bible](#the-hebrew-bible) as a foundational text and saw the development of reverence for the [Divine Name](#the-divine-name). The era culminated in the life of Jesus, whose [birth](#the-birth-of-jesus-and-the-calendar) and [ministry](#the-ministry-of-jesus) introduced new perspectives on the law. His ultimate [crucifixion](#the-crucifixion) remains a pivotal event in both Jewish and Christian history.
