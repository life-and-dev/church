# The Jewish Era and the Coming of the Messiah

The roots of Christian faith are deeply embedded in Jewish history, beginning with the foundational texts of the Tanakh, or Hebrew Bible. This article explores the historical backdrop of ancient Israel, the evolution of key religious practices, and the pivotal moments that preceded the arrival of Jesus Christ, setting the stage for a new chapter in spiritual history.

## The Foundation of the Tanakh

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is the Book of Genesis, which is estimated to have been written around 1445-1405 BC by Moses. Following Moses, numerous authoritative judges, kings, and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible), also known as the Hebrew Bible. These sacred texts chronicle the history of Israel, from its origins and the establishment of the nation to its eventual fall and the preservation of a remnant after the Babylonian exile. The Tanakh also contains a rich collection of literature about God, His creation, wisdom, laws, and teachings, which have held profound significance for non-Jewish nations, including Christians, into the modern era.

## The Apocrypha Question

A collection of books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus the Christ, known as the Apocrypha, is not accepted as authoritative by Protestant Christians and is therefore not included in their Bibles. The Catholic Church, however, does accept these books as part of its canon.

## The Substitution of God's Name

Although God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה, which translates to the Tetragrammaton YHVH, historical evidence suggests that a significant shift occurred sometime before the birth of Jesus, likely during the Second Temple era. At that time, **it became customary among the Jewish people to substitute "Adonai," meaning "Lord" in English, for the divine name "YHVH."** This practice is also reflected in Greek manuscripts, where references to God are often translated simply as "Lord." [This practice is detailed in the Wikipedia article on the Tetragrammaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton).

## The Anno Domini Era

While scholars disagree on the exact year of Jesus's birth, there is a general consensus that it occurred around the transition from the BC to the AD era in the Anno Domini year-numbering system. The Jewish community has traditionally not adopted this system, as it is based on the birth of Jesus Christ, whom they do not recognize as the Messiah.

## The Temple and Sacrificial System

The Tanakh describes how the ancient Israelites established a formal system of worship centered on the Temple, which included priestly rituals and animal sacrifices. This system was designed to provide a means for the people to be cleansed of their sins and achieve righteousness before God, particularly as they felt unworthy to approach Him directly.

## The Revolutionary Teachings of Jesus

During his lifetime, Jesus delivered a series of teachings that offered new interpretations of the Mosaic Law and challenged the religious and social norms of his time. He taught his disciples, who were primarily Jewish, about:
* A renewed understanding of the Mosaic laws, emphasizing love for God and neighbor over the strict observance of religious rituals.
* A fresh perspective on the character of God and His divine plan for humanity.
* The coming of the kingdom of God.
* The gospel of salvation, which taught that individuals could be saved without the need for priests or ritualistic sacrifices.
* Prophecies and warnings about future events.

These teachings created significant controversy within the Jewish community, and Jesus was ultimately sentenced to death for blasphemy after claiming to be the Christ—a title that the Jewish religious authorities of the time reserved for a prophesied savior of Israel.

## The Crucifixion of the Messiah

Many scholars agree that Jesus was crucified around AD 30–33.

## Conclusion

The Jewish era laid a foundational stone for what would become Christianity, providing the scriptures, prophecies, and the very cultural context for Jesus's ministry. From [the writing of the Tanakh](#the-foundation-of-the-tanakh) to [the shift in how God's name was spoken](#the-substitution-of-gods-name), this period was marked by significant theological developments. The [teachings of Jesus](#the-revolutionary-teachings-of-jesus) would later challenge and reinterpret these long-standing traditions, ultimately leading to his [crucifixion](#the-crucifixion-of-the-messiah) and the birth of a new faith.
