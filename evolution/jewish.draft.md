# The Jewish Era

The roots of modern faith and history are deeply intertwined with the ancient nation of Israel. This article examines the pivotal moments and influential figures of the Jewish Era that shaped the spiritual landscape of the world.

## Origins and the Tanakh

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is the Book of Genesis. Conservative scholars estimate it was written between 1445 and 1405 BC by Moses. Biblical records support this tradition:

> Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD — Exodus 24:4 (ESV)

While tradition ascribes the Torah to Moses, many modern scholars argue for a later composition by multiple authors. Proponents of Mosaic authorship point to internal biblical evidence and the long-standing tradition of the Jewish and Christian faiths as support for their view.

Since the time of Moses, many authoritative judges, kings, and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible), or Hebrew Bible. These books chronicle the history of Israel and how the nation came into existence. They also record the fall of Israel and how the remnant was maintained after the Babylonian exile. The Tanakh includes literature about the creation of the world, divine principles, and laws. These teachings and prophecies remain significant to many non-Jewish nations and Christians today.

## The Apocrypha

Bible books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus are often referred to as the Apocrypha. Protestant Christians generally do not accept the authority of these books and exclude them from their bibles. They argue that these books were not part of the original Hebrew canon. In contrast, the Catholic and Orthodox churches include them as part of their canonical scriptures, viewing them as divinely inspired and historically valuable.

## The Name of God

In the Hebrew scriptures, God identified Himself as יְהוָ֖ה, which translates to the Tetragrammaton YHVH. During the Second Temple era, Jewish tradition moved away from pronouncing this name out of reverence. It was replaced with "Adonai," which means "Lord." This transition is evident in ancient Greek manuscripts where God is frequently referred to as "Lord." Some modern groups advocate for the restoration of the original pronunciation, while traditional Judaism continues to use "Adonai" or "HaShem" (The Name).

## Calendar and Chronology

Scholars continue to debate the exact year of the birth of Jesus. Most agree it occurred near the transition between the BC and AD eras. The Anno Domini system counts years from the birth of Jesus, whom the Jewish community did not accept as the Messiah. Consequently, many Jewish historians and scholars use the BCE (Before Common Era) and CE (Common Era) notations to maintain a distinct historical perspective that does not rely on Christian theological assumptions.

## The Sacrificial System

The Tanakh describes how the Israelites established a priestly and sacrificial system. This system was introduced to allow the people to be righteous before God. It involved rituals and offerings at the temple to cleanse the people from their sins.

> If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish. He shall bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD. — Leviticus 1:3 (ESV)

Critiques of this system often focus on its perceived rigidity. However, proponents argue that the sacrificial laws served to teach the concepts of holiness, justice, and the serious nature of sin.

## Teachings of Jesus

During his life, Jesus taught and demonstrated moral standards for his disciples to follow. His teachings included:
* New perspectives on how to interpret Mosaic laws, focusing on love for God and neighbors.

> You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. — Matthew 22:37-39 (ESV)

* A fresh outlook on the character of God and His motives for humanity.
* The revelation of the Kingdom of God.
* The gospel of salvation, suggesting that personal faith and grace were central to being saved.
* Warnings and prophecies regarding the future of the nation and the world.

## Trial and Crucifixion

These teachings caused significant controversy within the Jewish community. Jesus was eventually sentenced to death for claiming to be the Christ. The Jewish authorities at the time considered this claim to be blasphemy, an offense punishable by death under their law.

> The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God." — John 10:33 (ESV)

Most historical scholars agree that Jesus was "crucified" around AD 30 to 33. Although some skeptics point to a lack of contemporary Roman documentation, historians highlight references to Jesus by later non-Christian writers like Tacitus and Josephus as evidence of his existence and execution.

## Conclusion

The Jewish Era established the foundation for modern biblical understanding through the development of the [Tanakh and its historical records](#origins-and-the-tanakh). This period also saw the emergence of the [Apocrypha](#the-apocrypha) and a significant shift in how the [name of God](#the-name-of-god) was pronounced. The evolution of [chronology and the calendar](#calendar-and-chronology) reflects the profound theological developments of the era. Furthermore, the [sacrificial system](#the-sacrificial-system) provided a framework for worship that would be deeply challenged. The [teachings of Jesus](#teachings-of-jesus) introduced revolutionary perspectives that eventually led to his [trial and crucifixion](#trial-and-crucifixion), marking a defining moment in history.
