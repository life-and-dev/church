# Jewish Era

The Jewish Era laid the foundation for much of the modern world's spiritual and moral understanding. This period saw the emergence of the Tanakh, the establishment of the Temple priesthood, and the profound shift in religious practice that occurred with the life and teachings of Jesus. By examining these roots, we can better understand the transition from ancient tradition to the dawn of a new era.

## Origins of the Tanakh

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is the Book of Genesis. It is estimated to have been written between 1445 and 1405 BC by Moses. Since Moses, many authoritative judges, kings, and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) (Hebrew Bible). These books center on the history of Israel. They document how the nation came into existence, the fall of Israel, and how God maintained a remnant after the Babylonian exile. The [development of the Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible#Development) spanned several centuries. The scriptures also include important literature about God and His creation. They provide wisdom, principles, laws, and teachings. These prophecies, blessings, and songs remain very important to non-Jewish nations, including Christians in the modern era.

## The Apocrypha

Bible books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus the Christ are considered [Apocrypha](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apocrypha) by Protestant Christians. They do not accept the authority of these books and did not include them in their Bibles. However, the Catholic Church does accept these books as part of the biblical canon.

## The Divine Name

God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה. This name directly translates to the [Tetragrammaton](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tetragrammaton) YHVH. Sometime before the birth of Jesus, likely during the Second Temple era, the Jews replaced the name YHVH with Adonai. This word means "Lord" in English. The shift is also evident in Greek manuscripts where the Jews refer to God as "Lord".

> God spoke to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel: 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations." — Exodus 3:15 (ESV)

## Chronology and the Calendar

Scholars disagree on the exact date of the birth of Jesus. Most agree it occurred near the transition of the Anno Domini year system. This system switches from BC era years to AD era years. Many Jews do not use this system. It starts counting from the birth of Jesus Christ, whom they rejected as the Messiah. Critics may argue that the Anno Domini system was only developed centuries later by Dionysius Exiguus. However, the system's focus on the birth of Christ remains the central point of contention for those who prefer the non-religious BCE and CE designations.

## Temple and Priesthood

The Tanakh describes how the Israelites refused to approach God directly. It also explains how the temple was built. A priestly and sacrificial system was introduced. This system was designed to cleanse people from their sin. It allowed them to maintain righteousness with God.

## Teachings of Jesus

While Jesus was alive, he taught and demonstrated moral standards to many disciples. Most of these followers were Jews. His teachings include several key elements. He provided fresh revelations on how to interpret the Mosaic laws. He focused on love and righteousness with God and one's neighbors. This was an alternative to merely obeying religious rituals.

> And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." — Matthew 22:37-40 (ESV)

Jesus also gave people a fresh perspective of the character of God. He explained God's plan and motives for humanity. His message included the revelation of the kingdom of God. He preached the gospel of salvation. This teaching suggested that people do not need priests and rituals to be saved. He also provided warnings and prophecies about the future.

## Trial and Crucifixion

These teachings caused a stir in the Jewish community. Jesus eventually received a death sentence for claiming to be the Christ. The Jewish priests considered this claim to be blasphemy. According to their law, blasphemy was punishable by death.

> But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God." Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven." Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death." — Matthew 26:63-66 (ESV)

Many scholars agree that Jesus was crucified around AD 30 to 33.

## Conclusion

The Jewish Era represents a period of significant development for the scriptures and religious practices that define the faith today. From the [Origins of the Tanakh](#origins-of-the-tanakh) and the preservation of the [Apocrypha](#the-apocrypha), to the transition of the [Divine Name](#the-divine-name), the era was marked by deep reverence for tradition. The complexities of [Chronology and the Calendar](#chronology-and-the-calendar) and the structure of the [Temple and Priesthood](#temple-and-priesthood) provided the context for the [Teachings of Jesus](#teachings-of-jesus). His eventual [Trial and Crucifixion](#trial-and-crucifixion) marked a pivotal moment that would influence history for centuries to come.
