# Jewish Era

The Jewish Era laid the foundation for the Christian faith, providing the historical and theological context in which Jesus Christ lived and taught. By exploring the origins of the Hebrew Scriptures, the development of intertestamental literature, and the cultural shifts of the Second Temple period, we can better understand the world that shaped early Christianity.

## The Tanakh and Early Canonical Writings

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is the Book of Genesis which is estimated to be written around 1445-1405 BC by Moses. Since Moses, many authoritative judges, kings and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) (Hebrew bible). These books are written around the history of Israel, how the nation came into existence, the fall of Israel and how God maintained the remnant after the Babylonian exile, but also include important literature about God, His creation, wisdom, principles, laws, teachings, prophecies, blessings and songs which are very important to non-Jewish nations, even to the Christians in the modern era.

In the Tanakh we read how the Israelites refused to approach God, as they were terrified by the manifestations of His presence at Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:18-21 (ESV)). Consequently, the temple was built and the priestly and sacrificial system was introduced to cleanse people from their sin in order to be righteous with God (Leviticus 1-7).

## The Apocrypha and Late Intertestamental Literature

Bible books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus the Christ are considered Apocrypha by the Christian Protestants who do not accept the authority of these books and did not include them in their bibles, although the Catholic churches do accept these books.

## The Transition from YHVH to Adonai

Although God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה, which directly translates to the Tetragrammaton YHVH, it is observed that some time before the birth of Jesus, most likely during the Second Temple era, **the Jews replaced the God's name "YHVH" with "Adonai" which means "Lord" in English**. This is also evident in the Greek manuscripts when the Jews refer to God as simply "Lord".

## The Anno Domini System and the Birth of Jesus

Although scholars disagree on the exact date Jesus was born, all agree that it was around the time the Anno Domini year system switched from BC era years to AD era years. Many Jews do not accept this system because the system starts counting from the birth of Jesus Christ (Messiah) whom they rejected.

## The Ministry and Teachings of Jesus

While Jesus was alive, he taught, demonstrated and set moral standards to many disciples (mainly Jews) to follow his teachings which include:
* fresh revelations on how people ought to interpret the Mosaic laws, with the focus on love and righteousness with God and their neighbours, instead of obeying religious rituals (Matthew 5-7 (ESV)).
* he gave people a fresh perspective of Who God is (His character) and what God's plan or motives are for humanity (John 1:18, 14:9 (ESV)).
* the revelation of God's kingdom.
* the gospel of salvation which means people do not need priests and rituals to be saved (Hebrews 10:11-14 (ESV); Ephesians 2:8-9 (ESV)).
* warnings and prophecies about the future.

## The Trial and Crucifixion of Jesus

These teachings caused a stir in the Jewish community of his time and he eventually received the death sentence for claiming to be the Christ which according to the Jewish priests was considered "blasphemy" which was punishable by death (Matthew 26:63-66 (ESV)). While some critics argue that the charge of blasphemy was a later theological development, his authoritative reinterpretation of the law and his responses to the High Priest provide strong evidence that he indeed claimed messianic authority, which was perceived as a direct challenge to the established religious order.

Many scholars agree that Jesus was "crucified" around AD 30 to 33.

## Conclusion

The Jewish Era established the [foundational scriptures and priestly systems](#the-tanakh-and-early-canonical-writings) that anticipated a coming Messiah. The [intertestamental period](#the-apocrypha-and-late-intertestamental-literature) saw the emergence of new literature and [cultural shifts in how God's name was used](#the-transition-from-yhvh-to-adonai). Finally, the [birth, ministry](#the-anno-domini-system-and-the-birth-of-jesus), and [teachings of Jesus](#the-ministry-and-teachings-of-jesus) challenged existing religious norms, leading to his [trial and crucifixion](#the-trial-and-crucifixion-of-jesus) and the birth of the Christian movement.
