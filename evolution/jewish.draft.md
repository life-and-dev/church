# Jewish Era

The Jewish Era represents a foundational period in human history, marking the emergence of the Hebrew Bible and the spiritual traditions that continue to shape the world today. This period traces the journey of a nation from its earliest canonical writings to the transformative teachings of Jesus Christ, providing a rich context for understanding the development of monotheistic faith and its enduring legacy.

## Origins of the Tanakh

The earliest known date of a canonical writing is attributed to the Book of Genesis, which traditional accounts estimate was written between 1445 and 1405 BC by Moses. While religious tradition has long held Moses as the primary author of the Pentateuch, many authoritative judges, kings, and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) (Hebrew Bible) over several centuries.

Some scholars suggest a later composition for these texts, proposing they may have reached their final form after the Babylonian exile in the fifth century BC. This creates a dialogue between traditional views and [historical-critical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_authorship). Despite these differing perspectives on authorship, the books documented how the nation of Israel came into existence, its eventual fall, and the preservation of a remnant after exile. They also include literature about God, His creation, and principles for conduct that remain foundational to modern Christians.

## The Intertestamental Period

Bible books written between 400 BC and the birth of Jesus the Christ are considered Apocrypha by Christian Protestants. These groups do not accept the authority of these books and do not include them in their Bibles. However, the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches do accept these books as part of their biblical canons, recognizing them as deuterocanonical.

## The Divine Name

Although God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה, which translates to the Tetragrammaton YHVH, Jewish tradition underwent a linguistic shift. Sometime before the birth of Jesus, most likely during the Second Temple era, the Jews began to replace the vocalization of God's name "YHVH" with "Adonai," which means "Lord" in English. This is also evident in the Greek manuscripts when the Jews refer to God as simply "Lord" or "Kyrios."

> God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel: 'I AM has sent me to you.'" God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel: 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations." — Exodus 3:14-15 (ESV)

## The Teachings of Jesus

Although scholars disagree on the exact date Jesus was born, it occurred around the time the Anno Domini year system switched from the BC era to the AD era. The Jews did not accept this system because it starts counting from the birth of Jesus Christ, whom they did not recognize as the Messiah.

While Jesus was alive, he taught, demonstrated, and set moral standards for his disciples. His teachings included fresh revelations on how people ought to interpret the Mosaic laws. He focused on love and righteousness with God and neighbors instead of obeying religious rituals.

> And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." — Matthew 22:37-40 (ESV)

Jesus also gave people a fresh perspective of God's character and motives for humanity. His message included the revelation of God's kingdom and the gospel of salvation, which taught that individuals could find redemption without exclusive reliance on priests and rituals.

## Crucifixion and Legacy

These teachings caused significant unrest in the Jewish community. Jesus eventually received the death sentence for claiming to be the Christ. According to the Jewish leadership of the time, this was considered blasphemy and was punishable by death.

Many scholars agree that Jesus was [crucified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus) between AD 30 and 33. This event marked a pivotal moment in history, influencing the development of the Christian faith and its relationship with Jewish tradition.

## Conclusion

The Jewish Era was a period of profound transformation, encompassing the [origins of the Tanakh](#origins-of-the-tanakh) and the diverse views of the [intertestamental period](#the-intertestamental-period). It saw significant shifts in [the divine name](#the-divine-name) and concluded with the influential [teachings of Jesus](#the-teachings-of-jesus) and his eventual [crucifixion](#crucifixion-and-legacy). Each of these elements contributed to the spiritual and historical foundation upon which multiple worldviews have since been built.
