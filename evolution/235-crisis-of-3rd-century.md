# 235 (Crisis of 3rd Century)

The Roman Empire, at its zenith, appeared an unshakeable colossus. Yet, a perfect storm of internal decay and external pressures would bring it to its knees. What were the catalysts for this near-collapse, and how did the empire pull itself back from the brink of annihilation?

## The Seeds of Crisis

[The Crisis of the Third Century](https://worldhistoryedu.com/crisis-of-the-thrid-century/) was a tumultuous 50-year period, beginning in 235, marked by profound political instability and the fragmentation of the Roman Empire. During this time, [at least 26 emperors—often called the "Barracks Emperors"—vied for power](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/crises-of-the-roman-empire/), with [many reigning for only a few months](https://www.worldhistory.org/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century/) before being overthrown.

A significant shift occurred in the perception of imperial authority. While emperors were no longer deified as in earlier times, they still held a divine association, though this was no longer tied to their lineage but rather their ability to command the loyalty of the military.

## Religious Shifts and Imperial Reforms

In 274 AD, Emperor [Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) instituted the cult of [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) ("Unconquered Sun") as an official state religion, in an effort to unify the empire under a single deity. [While some traditional accounts claim a temple dedication on December 25, 274](https://www.thecollector.com/cult-sol-invictus-roman-empire/), [modern scholars question this](https://www.historicmysteries.com/myths-legends/sol-invictus/38446/), [citing a lack of evidence for a Sol festival on this date before the mid-4th century](https://medium.com/christian-history-and-culture/why-is-christmas-on-december-25-7b7b6334fd84).

## The End of the Crisis

The crisis ultimately drew to a close with the ascension of [Diocletian as emperor in 284](https://www.thecollector.com/what-was-the-crisis-of-the-third-century/). He implemented sweeping reforms, including the establishment of the Tetrarchy—a co-emperor system—which brought stability and a clear line of succession, finally ending the cycle of chaos.

## Conclusion

The Crisis of the Third Century was a defining period in Roman history, characterized by [political instability and a rapid succession of emperors](#the-seeds-of-crisis). The era saw significant [religious reforms, including the rise of the cult of Sol Invictus](#religious-shifts-and-imperial-reforms), and ultimately [concluded with the stabilizing reforms of Diocletian](#the-end-of-the-crisis).
