# 494 (Valentine's Day)

Every February 14th, many celebrate a day of love and romance, but few know the complex and centuries-old story behind Valentine's Day. Was it a Christian replacement for a wild pagan festival, or does its origin lie with a martyred saint? This article explores the historical threads that wove together to create the holiday we know today.

## Pagan Origins: The Festival of Lupercalia

One of the most debated theories about the origin of Valentine's Day points to the ancient Roman festival of [Lupercalia](https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/ancient-history/lupercalia/), a fertility festival celebrated on February 15th. This festival was named after the Lupercal cave, where the legendary founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, were said to have been cared for by a she-wolf. Lupercalia involved animal sacrifices and matchmaking rituals.

While it is often claimed that Pope Gelasius I banned Lupercalia in 494 and replaced it with Valentine's Day, many modern scholars believe this is a later invention, as there is no clear evidence from the time to support a direct substitution.

> While it’s debated by some modern scholars, it was believed by others that there was a matchmaking lottery associated with the Lupercalia festival. During this time, men would draw women’s names from a hat, and the two would pair up for the duration of the festivities. This would follow suit with some modern-day matchmaking and romantic elements of this holiday. — [Charlotte Wilde](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/oldwaysinmoderntimes/2023/02/lupercalia-origins-and-modern-day-celebrations/)

## Christian Influence: The Legend of Saint Valentine

The holiday's namesake is Saint Valentine, a Christian martyr executed around 270 AD. According to legend, Emperor Claudius II had outlawed marriage for young men, believing that unmarried soldiers fought better than married ones. Valentine defied the emperor and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret.

There are many legends surrounding Saint Valentine. The most famous tells of him writing a letter to his jailer's daughter, whom he had healed from blindness, signing it "From your Valentine." This act cemented his association with love and affection.

## A Holiday Transformed

Despite the stories of Saint Valentine, the [day was not associated with romantic love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day#Chaucer's_love_birds) until much later. It was during the 14th century, influenced by the medieval traditions of courtly love, that Valentine's Day began to evolve into the romantic holiday we celebrate today. The first written connection between St. Valentine's Day and romance comes from Geoffrey Chaucer's 1382 poem, "Parlement of Foules," where he describes birds choosing their mates on the day. The first written valentine is believed to have been a poem written by Charles, Duke of Orléans, to his wife in 1415 while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London.
