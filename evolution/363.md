# 363 AD (Outlawing Sabbath)

During the Constantinian dynasty, **[institutional roles like the pope, bishops and clerics gradually evolved to maintain order in the church](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/The-alliance-between-church-and-empire)**.

At that time [Judaism was considered a rival religion](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitism-in-history-from-the-early-church-to-1400) to Christianity in the Roman Empire. [When Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century](https://free.messianicbible.com/feature/constantine-foundations-of-anti-semitism/), [institutionalized antisemitism developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_Judaism) through religious intolerance and political oppression, leading to intensified [persecution of Jews](https://remember.org/history-root-classical.html).

## The council of Laodicea

Therefore, in 363-364 [the council of Laodicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Laodicea), a Christian synod of 30 clerics from Asia Minor, regulated the conduct of church members by decrees in the form of written rules. This includes:
* **Determining the church order and behaviour of bishops, clerics and laypeople**
* Regulating the approach to heretics and Jews
* **Outlawing the keeping of the Sabbath (resting on Saturday)** to distinct themselves from "Jewish practices"
* **Encourage rest on Sundays**
* Outlining liturgical practices
* Restrictions during lent (a religious observance before Easter Sunday)
* The process how individuals are prepared for baptism and admission to the church
* [Specify the biblical canon](https://word.ofgod.info/books)

> "Christians must not [Judaize and rest on the Sabbath](../terms/sundays.md), but **must work on that day**, if possible;   
> but *the Lord's day* they must especially honour, and, as far as possible, must refrain from work. **If any one be found Judaizing, let him be anathema**." 
> 
> -- Canon 29
