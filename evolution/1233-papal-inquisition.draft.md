# 1233 (The Papal Inquisition)

How did the early church's emphasis on communal love evolve into the institutionalized systems of the [Middle Ages](dark-ages.md)? In 1233, the Roman Catholic Church established a centralized [papal-controlled apparatus](papal-authority.md) to "extirpate" heresy. This system, known as the [Papal Inquisition](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/papal-inquisition), redefined the relationship between ecclesiastical authority and individual dissent.

## The Centralization of Power

For centuries, the task of rooting out heretics belonged to local bishops (the episcopal inquisition). However, this approach was often inconsistent and ineffective against widespread movements like [Catharism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) in southern France.

In 1231, [Pope Gregory IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX) issued a decree in his *Statutes* that called for capital punishment for those who persisted in heresy. In 1233, he followed this with a series of papal bulls (such as *Ille humani generis*) that took inquisitorial power away from the bishops and placed it directly under papal control. He appointed members of the newly formed [Dominican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order) and [Franciscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan) orders as inquisitors. These men answered only to the pope, granting them nearly unlimited authority to investigate anyone suspected of "heretical depravity."

## The Inquisitorial Process

The Inquisition was designed to be impossible to escape. Its methods were revolutionary for the time:
*   **Secret Trials:** Proceedings were held in secret, and suspects were often not told the names of their accusers.
*   **Lack of Defense:** By 1254, [Pope Innocent IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_IV) had removed the right of the accused to have legal counsel, as providing a defense for a heretic was itself seen as an act of heresy.
*   **Systematic Records:** Every testimony and confession was meticulously recorded and kept in archives. Suspects could be tracked across borders and arrested years later based on these records.
*   **Self-Incrimination:** The goal was not just to find "truth" but to extract a confession. The accused were often forced to testify against themselves and their own families (a practice later restricted in modern law as "Fifth Amendment" rights).

## Authorization of Torture: Ad Extirpanda

Initially, the church avoided physical violence, following the principle *Ecclesia non sitit sanguinem* ("The Church does not thirst for blood"). However, as the fight against heresy intensified, this restraint was abandoned.

On 15 May 1252, Pope Innocent IV issued the bull [**Ad extirpanda**](http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1243-1254,_Innocentius_IV,_Bullarium,_LT.pdf) (PDF link to Latin text; [English summary here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_extirpanda)). This document officially authorized inquisitors to use **torture** as a tool for extracting confessions. While the bull technically forbade torture that caused the loss of life or limb, in practice, these limits were frequently circumvented by treating repeated torture sessions as a single "continued" session.

## Execution by Fire

For the church, a "heretic" was not just someone with a different opinion; they were a "cancer" on the body of Christ that had to be removed. If an accused person refused to recant their beliefs, or if they relapsed after a first confession, they were "handed over to the secular arm" for execution.

The preferred method was **burning at the stake**. By using the state (the "secular arm") to carry out the killing, the church maintained the legal fiction that it was not directly responsible for shedding blood, even though it was the church that passed the sentence.

> "The heretic is to be handed over to the secular power to be punished according to the law [execution by fire]." — Decree of Pope Gregory IX, 1231.

## The Church's Justification

The leaders of the medieval church did not see themselves as villains. They viewed heresy as a soul-destroying "cancer" that threatened the eternal salvation of the entire community. From their perspective, it was a sacred duty to protect the spiritual health of the "flock" and maintain the unity of the faith.

Supporters of the Inquisition argued that physical punishment was a necessary tool of discipline. They believed that the threat of torture or execution could lead a heretic to repentance. By recanting their beliefs, the accused could supposedly save their eternal soul from damnation. This outcome was considered far more important than their physical well-being.

## Contrast with the Teachings of Jesus

The practices of the Inquisition stood in direct opposition to the path set by Jesus. Where the church used fire to destroy its enemies, Jesus forbade his disciples from doing the same.

### Rebuking the Use of Fire
When Jesus was rejected by a Samaritan village, his disciples suggested a "holy" fire to consume them. Jesus' response was a direct rebuke of the spirit that would later drive the Inquisition:

> When the days drew near for him *[Jesus]* to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him. 
> 
> But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. 
> 
> And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, **"Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"**
> 
> But **he turned and rebuked them**.
> 
> — Luke 9:54-56 (ESV)

### Rejecting the Sword
Jesus also warned that those who resort to physical force in his name would ultimately be destroyed by it:

> Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place. For **all who take the sword will perish by the sword**." — Matthew 26:52 (ESV)

### The Commandment of Love
Finally, Jesus established love as the identifying mark of his followers. He did not emphasize doctrinal conformity enforced by violence.

> "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. **By this all people will know that you are my disciples**, if you have love for one another." — John 13:34-35 (ESV)

### God's Desire for Repentance
Even in the Old Testament, the LORD expressed a preference for repentance over the death of those who go astray:

> "Say to them, As I live, declares the LORD GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?" — Ezekiel 33:11 (ESV)

## Legacy of Institutionalized Violence

The Papal Inquisition did not end with the [Middle Ages](dark-ages.md); it evolved. In 1542, it became the [Roman Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition), and eventually, the **Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith** (which still exists today). While the use of fire and torture has been abandoned, the underlying claim of centralized authority to judge and punish "unorthodoxy" remains a core part of the system's history.

## Conclusion

The Papal Inquisition of 1233 represented a significant shift toward the [centralization of power](#the-centralization-of-power) within the Roman Catholic Church. This era introduced an [inquisitorial process](#the-inquisitorial-process) that prioritized extracted confessions and systematic punishment. However, these methods often stood in direct [contrast with the teachings of Jesus](#contrast-with-the-teachings-of-jesus), who emphasized love and repentance rather than institutionalized violence.
