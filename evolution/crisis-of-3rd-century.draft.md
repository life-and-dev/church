[The Crisis of the Third Century](https://worldhistoryedu.com/crisis-of-the-thrid-century/) started in 235, characterized by political instability and division in the Roman Empire. During this period, [at least 26 emperors ruled](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/crises-of-the-roman-empire/), [many of whom](https://www.worldhistory.org/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century/) were quickly removed from their thrones after only a few months. 

By this time emperors were no longer claiming to be divine. However, it was still common for emperors to be associated with divine authority, but this was not based on their bloodlines.

In 274 AD, the Roman [emperor Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) established the cult of [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) ("Unconquered Sun") as an official religion, alongside the traditional Roman cults. [While tradition claims a temple dedication on December 25, 274](https://www.thecollector.com/cult-sol-invictus-roman-empire/), [modern scholars dispute](https://www.historicmysteries.com/myths-legends/sol-invictus/38446/) this specific date, [noting limited evidence for a December 25 Sol festival before the mid-4th century](https://medium.com/christian-history-and-culture/why-is-christmas-on-december-25-7b7b6334fd84).

The Crisis of the Third Century only [ended when Diocletian became emperor](https://www.thecollector.com/what-was-the-crisis-of-the-third-century/) in 284. Diocletian stabilized the empire with a co-emperor system and clear lines of succession and governance.
