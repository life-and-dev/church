# The Crisis of the Third Century

The Crisis of the Third Century was a turbulent 50-year period from 235 to 284 AD, marked by intense political instability, civil war, and economic turmoil that nearly led to the collapse of the Roman Empire. During this time, at least 26 emperors rose and fell, many ruling for only a few months before being assassinated.

## Political Instability

The crisis began in 235 with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander and continued for five decades, with Roman generals fighting one another for control of the empire. By 268, the empire had fractured into three competing states: the Gallic Empire, the Palmyrene Empire, and the independent Roman Empire proper. By this time, emperors were no longer claiming to be divine, though they were still associated with divine authority.
