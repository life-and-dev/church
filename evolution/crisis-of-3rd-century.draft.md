# The Crisis of the Third Century

What happens when an empire, seemingly at the peak of its power, begins to crumble from within? The Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century reveals how quickly political instability, economic turmoil, and constant threats on its borders could unravel a superpower. This article explores this chaotic period, the rapid succession of emperors, and the eventual reforms that saved the empire from total collapse.

[The Crisis of the Third Century](https://worldhistoryedu.com/crisis-of-the-third-century/) started in 235, characterized by political instability and division in the Roman Empire. During this period, [at least 26 emperors ruled](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/crises-of-the-roman-empire/), [many of whom](https://www.worldhistory.org/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century/) were quickly removed from their thrones after only a few months.

By this time emperors were no longer claiming to be divine. However, it was still common for emperors to be associated with divine authority, but this was not based on their bloodlines.

In 274 AD, the Roman [emperor Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) established the cult of [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) ("Unconquered Sun") as an official religion, alongside the traditional Roman cults. [While tradition claims a temple dedication on December 25, 274](https://www.thecollector.com/cult-sol-invictus-roman-empire/), modern scholars dispute this specific date, [noting limited evidence for a December 25 Sol festival before the mid-4th century](https://medium.com/christian-history-and-culture/why-is-christmas-on-december-25-7b7b6334fd84).

<a name="diocletian"></a>
The Crisis of the Third Century only [ended when Diocletian became emperor](https://www.thecollector.com/what-was-the-crisis-of-the-third-century/) in 284. Diocletian stabilized the empire with a co-emperor system and clear lines of succession and governance. 

## Conclusion

The Crisis of the Third Century was a defining period for the Roman Empire, marking a shift from the stable Principate to the more autocratic Dominate. While the rapid succession of emperors and constant civil war nearly led to its downfall, the crisis also paved the way for the sweeping reforms of emperors like [Aurelian](#aurelian) and [Diocletian](#diocletian). Their actions, born out of necessity, not only reunited the fractured empire but also laid the groundwork for the Byzantine Empire, ensuring the legacy of Rome would endure for centuries to come.
