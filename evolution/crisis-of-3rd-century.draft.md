# The Crisis of the Third Century

What happens when an empire, seemingly at the peak of its power, begins to crumble from within? The Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century reveals how quickly political instability, economic turmoil, and constant threats on its borders could unravel a superpower. This article explores this chaotic period, the rapid succession of emperors, and the eventual reforms that saved the empire from total collapse.

[The Crisis of the Third Century](https://worldhistoryedu.com/crisis-of-the-third-century/) started in 235, characterized by political instability and division in the Roman Empire. During this period, [at least 26 emperors ruled](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/crises-of-the-roman-empire/), [many of whom](https://www.worldhistory.org/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century/) were quickly removed from their thrones after only a few months.

By this time emperors were no longer claiming to be divine. However, it was still common for emperors to be associated with divine authority, but this was not based on their bloodlines.

In 274 AD, the Roman [emperor Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) established the cult of [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) ("Unconquered Sun") as an official religion, alongside the traditional Roman cults. [While tradition claims a temple dedication on December 25, 274](https://www.thecollector.com/cult-sol-invictus-roman-empire/), modern scholars dispute this specific date, [noting limited evidence for a December 25 Sol festival before the mid-4th century](https://medium.com/christian-history-and-culture/why-is-christmas-on-december-25-7b7b6334fd84).

<a name="diocletian"></a>
The Crisis of the Third Century only [ended when Diocletian became emperor](https://www.thecollector.com/what-was-the-crisis-of-the-third-century/) in 284. To address the empire's vast challenges, Diocletian implemented a series of sweeping reforms that fundamentally restructured the Roman government, military, and economy.

### Shift in Imperial Divinity

After the crisis, the perception of the emperor's divinity underwent a significant transformation. Instead of being worshipped as gods themselves, emperors like Diocletian positioned themselves as chosen instruments of the divine. Diocletian, for example, adopted the title "Jovius," linking himself to the god Jupiter, not as a deity but as the god's earthly representative. This ideological shift helped legitimize imperial authority by grounding it in divine sanction, moving away from the chaotic cycle of military acclamations that defined the crisis. This new form of rule, known as the Dominate, emphasized the emperor's supreme and autocratic power, a stark contrast to the earlier Principate's illusion of shared governance with the Senate.

### Political and Administrative Reforms

Diocletian's most famous reform was the creation of the [Tetrarchy, or "rule of four"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian#Tetrarchy). Recognizing that the empire was too large for one person to govern effectively, he appointed Maximian as a co-emperor (Augustus) in the West, while he ruled the East. Later, he appointed two junior emperors (Caesars), Galerius and Constantius, creating a system of succession and dividing the empire's administrative and military burdens.

To further centralize control and reduce the power of provincial governors, Diocletian [doubled the number of provinces to almost 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian#Administrative) and grouped them into twelve dioceses. He also separated civil and military authority, ensuring that no single individual could command both an army and the resources of a wealthy province—a common recipe for usurpation during the crisis.

### Military Expansion

Under Diocletian, the Roman army was significantly [enlarged and reorganized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian#Military) to better defend its vast frontiers. He increased the number of legions and established a network of new forts and roads, including the *Strata Diocletiana* in the east, to improve communication and rapid deployment of troops. This expansion helped secure the borders against barbarian incursions and restored a sense of security after decades of constant threat.

### Economic Stabilization

To fund the expanded army and bureaucracy, Diocletian instituted a [comprehensive tax reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian#Taxation) based on a regular census of population (*capita*) and land (*iuga*). This new system created a more predictable and stable source of revenue for the state, replacing the chaotic and often corrupt system of requisitions that had prevailed during the crisis. He also attempted to combat hyperinflation by issuing the [Edict on Maximum Prices in 301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices), which set fixed prices for thousands of goods and services. Though the edict was largely unenforceable and ultimately failed, it represented an unprecedented effort to bring the empire's spiraling economy under control.

## Conclusion

The Crisis of the Third Century was a defining period for the Roman Empire, marking a shift from the stable Principate to the more autocratic Dominate. While the rapid succession of emperors and constant civil war nearly led to its downfall, the crisis also paved the way for the sweeping reforms of emperors like [Aurelian](#aurelian) and [Diocletian](#diocletian). Their actions, born out of necessity, not only reunited the fractured empire but also laid the groundwork for the Byzantine Empire, ensuring the legacy of Rome would endure for centuries to come.
