# The Crisis of the Third Century

The 3rd century was a period of intense turmoil for the Roman Empire, as it grappled with internal strife, economic depression, and external threats that brought it to the brink of collapse. How did the empire manage to survive this chaotic era, and what lasting changes did this crisis impose on Roman society and governance?

## The Imperial Turmoil

The [Crisis of the Third Century](https://worldhistoryedu.com/crisis-of-the-third-century/) began in 235, characterized by political instability and division in the Roman Empire. During this period, [at least 26 emperors ruled](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/crises-of-the-roman-empire/), [many of whom](https://www.worldhistory.org/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century/) were quickly removed from their thrones after only a few months.

By this time, emperors were no longer claiming to be divine. However, it was still common for them to be associated with divine authority, though this was not based on their bloodlines.

## The Rise of Sol Invictus

In 274 AD, the Roman [emperor Aurelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian) established the cult of [Sol Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) ("Unconquered Sun") as an official religion, alongside the traditional Roman cults. While tradition claims a temple dedication on December 25, 274, [modern scholars dispute](https://www.historicmysteries.com/myths-legends/sol-invictus/38446/) this specific date, [noting limited evidence for a December 25 Sol festival before the mid-4th century](https://medium.com/christian-history-and-culture/why-is-christmas-on-december-25-7b7b6334fd84).

## Diocletian's Reforms

The Crisis of the Third Century only [ended when Diocletian became emperor](https://www.thecollector.com/what-was-the-crisis-of-the-third-century/) in 284. Diocletian stabilized the empire by establishing the Tetrarchy, a co-emperor system that divided the empire into four parts, each ruled by a different emperor. This created clear lines of succession and governance, which helped to restore order.

## Conclusion

The Crisis of the Third Century was a period of immense turmoil that reshaped the Roman Empire, as outlined in the section on [The Imperial Turmoil](#the-imperial-turmoil). The rise of new religious cults like [Sol Invictus](#the-rise-of-sol-invictus) reflected the shifting cultural landscape of the time. Ultimately, the crisis was brought to an end by the sweeping [reforms of Diocletian](#diocletians-reforms), which laid the groundwork for the later Roman Empire.
