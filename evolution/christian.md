# The First Christians

Have you ever wondered how the followers of Jesus came to be known as "Christians"? This article delves into the historical context and scholarly debate surrounding the origin of this globally recognized term, exploring whether it began as a casual descriptor, a derogatory label, or something else entirely.

## Followers of "The Way"

Before they were called Christians, the earliest followers of Jesus were known as followers of "The Way." This designation appears several times in the book of Acts. For instance, Saul (who later became the Apostle Paul) persecuted the church by seeking to arrest "any who were of the Way" (Acts 9:2). Later, in his own defense, Paul states, "I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect" (Acts 24:14). This suggests that "The Way" was an early, self-identifying term for the nascent Christian community, emphasizing a new path of life and faith centered on Jesus's teachings. Jesus himself had declared, "I am the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6), which likely served as the foundational inspiration for this name.

## The Nickname from Antioch

The first recorded use of the term "Christian" appears in the New Testament. In the bustling city of [Antioch during the first century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century), the disciples of Jesus were first called ["Christians"](/bible/concepts/christian), which means "followers of the Anointed One" (Acts 11:26). This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a distinct identity for the burgeoning faith.

## A Derogatory Label or a Badge of Honor?

The original intent behind the name is a subject of [scholarly debate](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/75705/who-first-coined-the-term-christian). Some historians suggest the term was [initially an insult](https://discover.hubpages.com/religion-philosophy/the-term-christian-initially-was-an-insult), created by the citizens of Antioch who were known for coining mocking nicknames.

However, [other scholars contend](https://www.lavistachurchofchrist.org/cms/was-the-term-christian-originally-a-derogatory-reference/) that the term may have had a more formal, or even divine, origin. They point out that the Greek word *chrematisai*, translated as "were called" in Acts 11:26, often implies a divine revelation. Additionally, the "-ian" suffix was a common Latin form to denote allegiance, much like "Caesariani" referred to the soldiers of Caesar. This suggests the name could have been a straightforward descriptor of allegiance to Christ.

## Embracing the Title

Regardless of its origin, the followers of Jesus quickly embraced the "Christian" title. The Apostle Peter, for instance, encouraged believers not to be ashamed if they "suffer as a Christian, but let him glorify God in this matter" (1 Peter 4:16). What might have started as a simple label in Antioch soon became a badge of honor and a defining name for a worldwide faith.

## Conclusion

Before being known as [Christians](#the-nickname-from-antioch), the first believers identified as followers of ["The Way."](#followers-of-the-way) The term "Christian" later emerged in Antioch, and while its origins are debated as either [derogatory or descriptive,](#a-derogatory-label-or-a-badge-of-honor) it was [embraced by the early church](#embracing-the-title) and became the enduring name for a global faith.
