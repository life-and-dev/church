# The First Christians

Have you ever wondered how the followers of Jesus came to be known as "Christians"? This article delves into the historical context and scholarly debate surrounding the origin of this globally recognized term, exploring whether it began as a casual descriptor, a derogatory label, or something else entirely.

## The Nickname from Antioch

The first recorded use of the term "Christian" appears in the New Testament. In the bustling city of [Antioch during the first century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century), the disciples of Jesus were first called ["Christians"](/bible/concepts/christian), which means "followers of the Anointed One" (Acts 11:26). This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a distinct identity for the burgeoning faith.

## A Derogatory Label or a Badge of Honor?

The original intent behind the name is a subject of [scholarly debate](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/75705/who-first-coined-the-term-christian). Some historians suggest the term was [initially an insult](https://discover.hubpages.com/religion-philosophy/the-term-christian-initially-was-an-insult), created by the citizens of Antioch who were known for coining mocking nicknames.

However, [other scholars contend](https://www.lavistachurchofchrist.org/cms/was-the-term-christian-originally-a-derogatory-reference/) that the term may have had a more formal, or even divine, origin. They point out that the Greek word *chrematisai*, translated as "were called" in Acts 11:26, often implies a divine revelation. Additionally, the "-ian" suffix was a common Latin form to denote allegiance, much like "Caesariani" referred to the soldiers of Caesar. This suggests the name could have been a straightforward descriptor of allegiance to Christ.

## Embracing the Title

Regardless of its origin, the followers of Jesus quickly embraced the "Christian" title. The Apostle Peter, for instance, encouraged believers not to be ashamed if they "suffer as a Christian, but let him glorify God in this matter" (1 Peter 4:16). What might have started as a simple label in Antioch soon became a badge of honor and a defining name for a worldwide faith.

## Conclusion

The term "Christian" first emerged in [Antioch](#the-nickname-from-antioch) as a way to identify the followers of Jesus. While scholars debate whether it was [derogatory or descriptive](#a-derogatory-label-or-a-badge-of-honor), it is clear that early believers [fully embraced the name](#embracing-the-title) as their own, transforming it into the enduring identity of a global religion.
