# 206 (Tertullian)

Tertullian, a prolific early Christian author, left an indelible mark on Western theology. But how did this trained Roman lawyer, who later in life adopted the controversial Montanist movement, come to shape foundational Christian doctrines? This article explores his most significant contributions, from coining the term "Trinity" to his views on church structure, and examines which of his ideas were embraced and which were ultimately rejected by the Church.

## Theological Contributions

In 206 AD, [Tertullian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) [adopted](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tertullian) [Montanism](/kingdom/church/history/montanism.md)[^1] after [being an orthodox Christian for approximately 9-11 years](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm). He invented theological concepts like:

*   **"Trinitas"**[^2]: This is the Latin term for the [Trinity](/bible/doctrines/trinitarian.md). Tertullian's version of the Trinity was complex and leaned towards [modalism](/bible/interpretations/jesus/comparison.md#modalism) [^3], which he described as "unam substantiam in tribus cohaerentibus" (one substance in three coherent and inseparable [Persons]) [^4]. This formulation is [still influential in many Latin churches today](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2074-77052021000100066).
*   **"Substantia"**[^5]: This Latin word for "substance" means ["material with particular physical characteristics"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/substance). [Tertullian used this term to explain that God was made up of one divine substance](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23954327). This differs from the modern view which sees the Trinity as three distinct persons who are of the same substance.
*   **"Persona"**[^5]: Meaning "presence" or "person" in Latin, [Tertullian used this term to explain that God consists of three divine persons who share a single "substance"](https://www.1517.org/articles/one-substance-with-the-father). [These terms balance unity and diversity within the Trinity](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2074-77052021000100066), allowing God to be viewed as one God in three distinct persons who can interact with each other.
*   **"Subordinationism"**: This concept describes a hierarchical relationship within the Trinity[^6]. The Father was considered the supreme person, with the Son subordinate to Him. Tertullian viewed the divine Son as inferior to the Father. This differs from the modern view, which sees the three persons of the Trinity as equal in dignity and authority.
*   **"Verbum"**: The Latin for "Word," Tertullian used this term to refer to the Greek [Logos](/bible/concepts/word.md) philosophy. This philosophy teaches that [the Son is "the Word"](/god/son/essence/as-god/word.md), providing proof that He pre-existed as a person of God before creation. Although Tertullian did not invent this Greek philosophy, he documented it in Latin for the church.

Tertullian wrote:

> And at the same time [the mystery](/bible/concepts/mystery) of the oikonomia is safeguarded, for the unity is distributed in a Trinity. Placed in order, the three are the Father, Son, and Spirit. They are three, however, not in condition, but in degree; not in being, but in form; not in power, but in kind; of one being, however, and one condition and one power, because he is one God of whom degrees and forms and kinds are taken into account in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. -- [Against Praxeas](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian17.html)

To summarise, according to Tertullian, the unity of God can be explained as:

| God is 1 in... | God is 3 in... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| substance      | persons        |
| condition      | degrees        |
| being          | forms          |
| power          | kinds          |

## Ecclesiastical Views

In addition, Tertullian supported the following views, which were adopted by the Catholic Church:

*   [**Apostolic succession**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_succession): The belief that the ministry of the Christian Church is derived from the apostles through a continuous succession, usually associated with a line of bishops.
*   **The Eucharist**: He affirmed the significance of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Supper_in_Reformed_theology) in Christian worship.
*   **Clergy-Laity Distinction**: He emphasised the importance of proper clerical training and authority, making a clear distinction between clergy and laity.

## Rejected Views

However, not all of Tertullian's views were acceptable to the church. For example, the following views were not accepted by the Church:

*   [**Subordination**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subordinationism) of [the Son](/god/son.md) and [the Holy Spirit](/god/spirit.md) to [the Father](/god/father.md).
*   **Accepted the Apocrypha**: He considered the Shepherd of Hermas, Judith, Enoch, and the Epistle of Barnabas as authoritative.
*   **Reservations about Mary's virginity**: Tertullian expressed some reservations about the perpetual virginity of Mary.

## Conclusion

Tertullian's legacy is a complex one. While his [theological innovations](#theological-contributions), particularly the concept of the Trinity, became cornerstones of Christian doctrine, his [ecclesiastical views](#ecclesiastical-views) helped shape the structure of the Western Church. Nevertheless, some of his beliefs, such as the subordination of the Son and Holy Spirit, were ultimately [rejected](#rejected-views) by mainstream Christianity. His story serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often contentious process of theological development in the early Church.
