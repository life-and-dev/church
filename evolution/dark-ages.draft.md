# The Dark Ages

The transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages was marked by monumental shifts in political and religious power. This period, often called the Dark Ages, saw the once-mighty Roman Empire fracture into competing states. It also witnessed the rise and fall of various Germanic kingdoms that held contrasting theological views.

## Split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire).

## Fall of Western Rome

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states. These included the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain. The Bible notes that God determines the periods and boundaries of nations:

> And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place — Acts 17:26 (ESV)

## Decline of Arian Nations

In 507, the [Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) were defeated by the Franks under Clovis I during the [Battle of Vouillé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vouill%C3%A9).

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants dispersed and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) adopted [Nicene orthodoxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripert_I) under King Aripert I.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages began with the [division of the Roman Empire into two states](#split-of-the-roman-empire), which fundamentally changed the Mediterranean political landscape. This process continued with the [eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire](#fall-of-western-rome) to Germanic tribes, leading to the fragmentation of its territories. During this era of transition, the [Arian nations also saw a significant decline](#decline-of-arian-nations) as they were either militarily defeated or converted to Nicene orthodoxy.
