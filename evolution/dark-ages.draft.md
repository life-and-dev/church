# The Transition of Power in the Early Middle Ages

The fall of the Roman Empire is often viewed as a sudden catastrophe, yet it
was a complex transition that reshaped the map of Europe and the Mediterranean.
This process followed the instability of the [Crisis of the Third
Century](235-crisis-of-3rd-century.md). As the old imperial structures crumbled,
a new landscape of Germanic kingdoms emerged, bringing with them unique
religious and political challenges. How did the once-mighty empire fragment into
these successor states, and what role did the Arian faith play in this turbulent
era?

## Division of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE, the [Roman Empire split into two separate
states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html).
This followed the death of Emperor Theodosius I. His two sons succeeded him.
Honorius ruled the Western Roman Empire. Arcadius governed the Eastern Roman
Empire.

## Collapse of the Western Empire

In 476 CE, [the Western Roman Empire
fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar.
He was a Germanic king often referred to as a barbarian leader. This event
traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman
Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm).

Odovacar sent the western imperial regalia, including the crown and scepter, to
Constantinople. This city served as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire,
also known as the Byzantine Empire. The act acknowledged the supremacy of the
Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented.
Various Germanic kingdoms and successor states emerged. These included the
Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## Decline of the Arian Kingdoms

The Arian kingdoms flourished after the fall of Rome but eventually faced
decline. [Arianism](337-arianism.md) was a doctrine that challenged the divinity
of Christ and gained significant influence among Germanic tribes. The decline
occurred through either military defeat or religious conversion.

In 507, the [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) was
defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé. This defeat
forced them to withdraw from most of Gaul. They maintained an Arian state in
Hispania until 589. During that year, King Reccared I converted to Catholicism
at the Third Council of Toledo.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism), an Arian
Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the
Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed. They ceased to function as a
cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) was
defeated by the Byzantine Empire. This followed a long and devastating war. The
victory briefly restored imperial control over the Italian peninsula.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) adopted Nicene
orthodoxy under King Aripert I. This marked the final transition of a major
Germanic kingdom away from Arianism in Italy.

No Arian nations survived as distinct political entities. However, [Arianism
persisted among certain Germanic
groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

## Conclusion

The transition of power during the early Middle Ages was marked by significant
shifts in both political authority and religious alignment. The [division of the
Roman Empire](#division-of-the-roman-empire) and the subsequent [collapse of the
Western Empire](#collapse-of-the-western-empire) created a power vacuum that was
filled by Germanic kingdoms. These [Arian kingdoms eventually
declined](#decline-of-the-arian-kingdoms) as they were assimilated through
conquest or conversion, setting the stage for the religious landscape of
medieval Europe.
