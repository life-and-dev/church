# The Dark Ages

The collapse of the Western Roman Empire was a turning point in history. This
article explores the fragmentation of a once-mighty power and the subsequent
rise and fall of various Germanic kingdoms. It examines how political and
theological shifts shaped the landscape of Europe during this transitional
period.

## The split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate
states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html)
after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I. His two sons Honorius and
Arcadius succeeded him. Honorius ruled the Western Roman Empire. Arcadius ruled
the Eastern Roman Empire.

## The fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire
fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odoacer.
He was the Germanic king often called a barbarian. This event traditionally
marks [the end of the Western Roman
Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm).
Odoacer sent the western imperial regalia to Constantinople. These items
included the crown and scepter. This act acknowledged the supremacy of the
Eastern Emperor.

The fall of the Western Roman Empire led to fragmented territories. Various
Germanic kingdoms and successor states emerged. These included the Ostrogothic
Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

Some interpreters view the fragmentation of the Roman Empire as a fulfillment
of biblical prophecy. The prophet Daniel described a kingdom that would be
divided.

> As you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it
> shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it,
> just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. — Daniel 2:41 (ESV)

## The fall of the Arian nations

In 507, the Franks defeated the
[Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) at the Battle of Vouillé.
Clovis I led the Franks to this victory.

In 534, the Byzantine Empire defeated the
[Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism). They were an Arian Germanic
tribe. This occurred during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed.
They ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the Byzantine Empire defeated the
[Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths).

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) adopted the
Nicene orthodoxy. This happened under King Aripert I.

No Arian nations survived as distinct political entities. However, [Arianism
persisted among certain Germanic
groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) for some time.

## Comparison of belief systems

The transition from Arianism to Nicene orthodoxy was a significant theological
shift. These two systems held different views on the nature of God.

Nicene Christianity teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are of the
same substance. They are co-eternal and co-equal. This view became the
mainstream doctrine of the Catholic and Orthodox churches.

Arianism taught that Jesus Christ was a created being. They believed he was
subordinate to God the Father. This view was popular among many Germanic
tribes. The conversion of these tribes to Nicene orthodoxy often followed
political alliances or military defeats.

Critics might argue that these conversions were purely political rather than
spiritual. However, the adoption of Nicene orthodoxy provided a unifying
religious framework for the emerging European nations. It helped bridge the gap
between the Germanic rulers and the majority Roman population.

## Conclusion

The transition from the Roman Empire to various Germanic kingdoms marked the
beginning of the Dark Ages. The empire first [split into two
states](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire). Later, the Western Roman Empire
[fell to Germanic rulers](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire). Over time, the
[Arian nations also fell](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations) or converted to
Nicene orthodoxy. This theological shift was solidified by a [comparison of
belief systems](#comparison-of-belief-systems) that favored Nicene views.
