# The Dark Ages

The transition from the classical world to the medieval era was marked by profound shifts in power, culture, and religion. As the Roman Empire fragmented, the landscape of Europe was redrawn by the emergence of Germanic kingdoms and the struggle for religious orthodoxy. This period of significant change, often referred to as the Dark Ages, laid the foundations for the future of the continent.

## The split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE, the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Empire) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I. He was succeeded by his two sons, Honorius, who ruled the Western Roman Empire, and Arcadius, who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire. This division was intended to make the vast empire easier to manage, but it also highlighted the growing differences between the Latin-speaking West and the Greek-speaking East.

## The fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE, [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odoacer, the Germanic king. This event traditionally marks the end of the Western Empire. Odoacer sent the western imperial regalia, including the crown and scepter, to Constantinople. This act acknowledged the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor in the rival Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire.

Following the fall, the territories of the Western Empire fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and successor states. These included the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain. This fragmentation aligns with the biblical prophecy of a divided kingdom:

> And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle. As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay. — Daniel 2:41-43 (ESV)

The prophecy further describes how these kingdoms would be partly strong and partly brittle, much like the disparate states that emerged from the ruins of Rome.

## The fall of the Arian nations

The early medieval period also saw the decline of Arianism, a theological view that conflicted with the Nicene orthodoxy favored by the Roman Church. Several Germanic nations that had adopted Arianism eventually fell or converted.

In 507, the [Visigothic kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) fell to the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé. In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily overcome by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive nation.

The [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire in 553. Later, in 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I. Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, although [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) for some time.

## Defining the Dark Ages

The term "Dark Ages" is sometimes criticized by modern historians who prefer terms like "Late Antiquity" or "Early Middle Ages." Critics argue that "Dark Ages" unfairly implies a lack of culture or progress. However, the term serves as a valid descriptor for the relative scarcity of written records from this period compared to the preceding Roman era. It also reflects the significant social and political upheaval as the centralized Roman authority gave way to localized Germanic rule.

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages was a period of intense transformation that saw the [split of the Roman Empire](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire) and the eventual [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire). This era also witnessed the [decline of the Arian nations](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations), as religious and political landscapes shifted toward the structures that would define medieval Europe. These events collectively represent the [definition of the Dark Ages](#defining-the-dark-ages) as a time of both fragmentation and foundational change.
