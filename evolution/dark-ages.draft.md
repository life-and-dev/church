# The Dark Ages

The transition from the height of the Roman Empire to the era commonly known as the Dark Ages remains one of the most significant shifts in Western history. This period was marked by political fragmentation, the rise of Germanic kingdoms, and profound changes in religious alignment. Understanding how a unified empire gave way to a decentralized landscape reveals much about the foundations of modern Europe.

## Split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire).

## Fall of the Western Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain. While 476 CE is traditionally cited as the end of the empire, some historians view the transition as a gradual transformation that occurred over several centuries rather than a sudden collapse. Despite this perspective, the events of 476 CE remain a significant milestone marking the end of unified imperial rule in the West.

## Fall of the Arian Nations

Arianism was a theological belief that denied the full divinity of Jesus Christ. It proposed that he was a created being, distinct from God the Father. This worldview was widely adopted by Germanic tribes during the migration period. However, it conflicted with the Nicene orthodoxy supported by the Roman Church and the Byzantine Empire.

In 507, the [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé. This defeat significantly reduced their territory and influence.

In 534, the [Vandal Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals) was militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive political entity.

In 553, the [Ostrogothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) was defeated by the Byzantine Empire following a prolonged conflict.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) adopted the Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I. This marked the end of their status as an Arian nation.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, although [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) for some time. The removal of these Arian powers is often seen as fulfilling biblical prophecies regarding the rise of a new authority in Europe.

> After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. — Daniel 7:7,8 (ESV)

> As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time. — Daniel 7:24,25 (ESV)

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages began with the [division of the Roman Empire](#split-of-the-roman-empire) and were solidified by the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#fall-of-the-western-empire). The subsequent [collapse of the Arian nations](#fall-of-the-arian-nations) reshaped the religious and political landscape of Europe, paving the way for new authorities to emerge. These events collectively represent a profound shift from ancient civilization to the medieval world.
