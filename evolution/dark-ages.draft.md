# The Dark Ages

The period known as the Dark Ages represents a significant turning point in European history. As the once-mighty Roman Empire began to fragment, new kingdoms emerged, and a religious struggle for dominance unfolded between Nicene Christianity and various Arian groups. This era of transition laid the groundwork for the medieval world.

## Split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire).

## Fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain. This fragmentation was foretold in biblical prophecy, which described a kingdom that would become divided.

> And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. — Daniel 2:41 (ESV)

## Fall of the Arian Nations

The religious landscape of Europe shifted significantly as Arian kingdoms fell or converted to the Nicene faith. Arianism, which differed from the state-sanctioned Nicene creed regarding the nature of God, was the predominant faith among many Germanic tribes.

In 507, the Visigoths were defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé. This victory expanded Frankish control and promoted Nicene Christianity in the region.

In 534, the Vandals, an Arian Germanic group, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the Ostrogoths were defeated by the Byzantine Empire, ending their rule in Italy.

In 653, the Lombards adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I, marking the end of Arianism as a state-sponsored religion.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism). This process of uprooting kingdoms to establish a new power structure mirrors the biblical description of a rising power that would put down three kings.

> As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. — Daniel 7:24 (ESV)

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages witnessed the final [split of the Roman Empire](#split-of-the-roman-empire) and the subsequent [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#fall-of-the-western-roman-empire) to Germanic leaders. These events led to the fragmentation of the empire into multiple kingdoms, which eventually saw the [fall of the Arian nations](#fall-of-the-arian-nations) and the rise of Nicene Christianity as the dominant religious force in Europe.
