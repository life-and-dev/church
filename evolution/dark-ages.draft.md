# The Dark Ages

The period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire is often referred to as the Dark Ages, a time of profound transformation and uncertainty. While modern historians often prefer the term "Early Middle Ages" to avoid the pejorative connotations of "darkness," the term remains a common descriptor for the era of dramatic transition that followed the Roman collapse. As the once-mighty Roman structures crumbled, new Germanic kingdoms emerged, bringing with them diverse religious beliefs, including Arianism. This article explores the pivotal events of this era, from the initial split of the empire to the eventual fall of the Arian nations and the rise of Nicene orthodoxy, shaping the future of European civilization and the Christian church.

## The Split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire).

## The Fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event is traditionally considered [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm). Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire). This act acknowledged the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## The Fall of the Arian Nations

The fall of the Arian kingdoms marked a significant shift in the religious landscape of Europe. Many of these nations, which held to Arianism rather than the Nicene Creed, were militarily defeated or absorbed by powers that supported Nicene orthodoxy. This transition is sometimes viewed through the lens of biblical prophecy, such as the ten horns in the book of Daniel.

> As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. — Daniel 7:24 (ESV)

In 507, the [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](337-arianism.md), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](337-arianism.md) adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](337-arianism.md).

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages were a time of significant political and religious change. The [split of the Roman Empire](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire) and the subsequent [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire) created a power vacuum that was filled by Germanic kingdoms. The eventual [fall of the Arian nations](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations) and their conversion to Nicene orthodoxy solidified the religious foundation of medieval Europe, paving the way for the dominant influence of the church in the centuries that followed.
