# The Dark Ages

The transition from the height of the Roman Empire to the fragmented landscape of the Early Middle Ages is a period of profound change. Often called the Dark Ages, this era witnessed the collapse of ancient structures and the rise of new powers that would shape the future of Europe. This article examines the events that led to the division of the empire and the eventual disappearance of once-dominant kingdoms.

## The split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire). This division is frequently compared to the prophetic description of a kingdom that becomes divided.

> The kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron — Daniel 2:41 (KJV)

## The fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odoacer, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odoacer sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## The fall of the Arian nations

In 507, the [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism). This large-scale disappearance of kingdoms reflects the biblical principle of divine sovereignty over the rise and fall of nations.

> He removeth kings, and setteth up kings — Daniel 2:21 (KJV)

## Impact on Christianity

The decline and eventual disappearance of Arian nations had a profound effect on the development of Christianity. With the fall of these kingdoms, the [Nicene Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed) and the doctrine of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity) became the dominant and virtually unchallenged standards of faith in Western Europe. The separate church hierarchies that had served Arian elites were abolished, leading to a more unified religious landscape under the authority of the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church).

During this era, the collapse of Roman imperial authority in the West allowed the [Papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_papacy) to gain significant spiritual and temporal influence. The Church became the primary unifying institution across a fragmented continent. Simultaneously, [monasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_monasticism) flourished, with monasteries serving as vital centers for the preservation of classical knowledge and the spread of the faith through [missionary activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization). These developments laid the foundation for the religious and political structures of the High Middle Ages.

## Historiography and the Dark Ages

Modern historians often critique the use of the term "Dark Ages" to describe the Early Middle Ages. While the fall of the Western Roman Empire led to significant political and economic changes, many scholars argue that the period was not one of total cultural stagnation. They point to the continued flourishing of the Byzantine Empire and the preservation of classical knowledge in various regions as evidence of ongoing intellectual life. Critics suggest that the label "Dark Ages" reflects the biases of later Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers rather than the historical reality of the era. However, the term remains popular in general discourse to describe the transition from antiquity to the medieval period.

## Conclusion

The era traditionally known as the Dark Ages was defined by the [split of the Roman Empire](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire) and the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire). These monumental shifts eventually led to the [fall of the Arian nations](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations) and a significant [impact on Christianity](#impact-on-christianity) through the rise of Nicene dominance. The period is also a subject of ongoing [historiographical debate](#historiography-and-the-dark-ages) regarding its cultural and intellectual complexity.
