# The Dark Ages

The term "Dark Ages" has been a subject of debate among historians, with its meaning and relevance often questioned. However, it is undeniable that the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a time of significant transformation in Europe. This article explores the key events that marked this era, from the division of the Roman Empire to the fall of various Germanic kingdoms.

## The split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire).

## The fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## The fall of the Arian nations

In 507, the [Visigothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths), was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I, who defeated them in the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths), were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism) adopted the Nice orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

## Conclusion

The era known as the Dark Ages was a period of profound change, initiated by the [division of the Roman Empire](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire) and cemented by the subsequent [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire). This led to the fragmentation of its territories and the rise of various Germanic kingdoms. The eventual [fall of the Arian nations](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations) further shaped the political and religious landscape of Europe, leaving a lasting legacy on the continent.
