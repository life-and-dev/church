# The Dark Ages

The period traditionally known as the Dark Ages marks a pivotal transition in European history. This era saw the decline of the Western Roman Empire and the rise of various Germanic kingdoms. This article explores the events that reshaped the political and religious landscape of Europe during this time.

## Empire Split

In 395 CE, the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I. He was succeeded by his two sons, Honorius, who ruled the Western Roman Empire, and Arcadius, who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire.

## Western Fall

In 476 CE, [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odoacer, a Germanic king. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm). Odoacer sent the western imperial regalia, including the crown and scepter, to Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. This act acknowledged the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall, the western territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms. These included the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain. This period of shifting power reflects the biblical principle that authority is ultimately granted by a higher power.

> He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding — Daniel 2:21 (ESV)

## Arian Nations

[Arianism](337-arianism.md) was a Christian belief that Jesus was created by God the Father and was therefore not co-eternal or of the same substance. This belief was common among many Germanic tribes.

In 507, the [Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) were defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

While no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups for some time.

## Belief Systems

The transition from the Roman Empire to the Germanic kingdoms involved a significant religious divide between Arianism and Nicene Orthodoxy.

| Tenet | Nicene Orthodoxy | Arianism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature of Christ** | Jesus is co-eternal and of the same substance as the Father. | Jesus is a created being, subordinate to the Father. |
| **The Trinity** | God exists as three co-equal persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. | Rejects the Trinity; the Father is the only true God. |

This theological difference had societal implications. Arian rulers often governed over a Nicene-majority Roman population. While some Arian kings were tolerant, the religious divide remained a source of tension until the Germanic tribes eventually converted to Nicene Christianity.

## Modern View

The term "Dark Ages" was originally coined to describe a perceived lack of cultural and scientific advancement after the fall of Rome. However, many modern historians argue against this characterization. They point out that this was a period of significant transformation and development. The era laid the groundwork for the cultural and political structures of medieval Europe. While it was a time of conflict and change, it was also a time of innovation and the preservation of knowledge in monasteries.

## Conclusion

In summary, the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages was marked by the [split of the Roman Empire](#empire-split) and the subsequent [fall of the West](#western-fall). The rise and eventual [decline of Arian nations](#arian-nations) further shaped the religious identity of Europe. Today, a [modern perspective](#modern-view) recognizes this era not merely as a time of darkness, but as a crucial period of transformation that defined the future of the continent.
