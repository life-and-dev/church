# 395 (Dark Ages)

The transition from the height of the Roman Empire to the fragmented landscape of the Early Middle Ages is a period of profound change. Often called the Dark Ages, this era witnessed the collapse of ancient structures and the rise of new powers that would shape the future of Europe. This article examines the events that led to the division of the empire and the eventual disappearance of once-dominant kingdoms.

## The split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire). This division is frequently compared to the prophetic description of a kingdom that becomes divided.

## The fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odoacer, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odoacer sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## The fall of the Arian nations

In 507, the [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

## Conclusion

The era traditionally known as "the Dark Ages" was defined by the [split of the Roman Empire](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire) and the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire). These monumental shifts eventually led to the [fall of the Arian nations](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations) across the European continent.
