# The Dark Ages

The term "Dark Ages" often conjures images of chaos and decline, yet it was a period of profound transformation that reshaped the course of Western civilization. This article delves into the pivotal events that marked the beginning of this era, starting with the fracture of the mighty Roman Empire. We will explore the subsequent fall of the Western Roman Empire and the gradual disappearance of the Arian nations, examining how these events set the stage for a new chapter in European history.

## The split of the Roman Empire

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, who was succeeded by his two sons Honorius (the Western Roman Empire) and Arcadius (the Eastern Roman Empire).

## The fall of the Western Roman Empire

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic ("Barbarian") King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm), because Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia (crown, scepter, orb, etc.) to Constantinople, the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states, such as the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## The fall of the Arian nations

In 507, the [Visigothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths), was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I, who defeated them in the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed, and they ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths), were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) adopted the Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

Thus, no Arian nations survived as distinct political entities, but [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages were initiated by [the division of the Roman Empire](#the-split-of-the-roman-empire), which created a lasting schism between East and West. This period was further defined by [the collapse of the Western Roman Empire](#the-fall-of-the-western-roman-empire) and the subsequent fragmentation of its territories into various Germanic kingdoms. Finally, the era saw [the decline of the Arian nations](#the-fall-of-the-arian-nations), as many Germanic tribes were either conquered or converted to Nicene orthodoxy. These events collectively transformed the political and religious landscape of Western Europe, paving the way for the developments of the medieval period.
