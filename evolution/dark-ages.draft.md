# The Dark Ages

The transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages was marked by monumental shifts in power and ideology. Following the final division of the Roman Empire, a series of conflicts and cultural transformations reshaped Europe, leading into the era often referred to as the Dark Ages. This period saw not only the collapse of imperial structures but also the definitive end of Arianism as a dominant political force among Germanic nations.

## Roman Empire Division

In 395 CE the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-division-of-rome-into-eastern-and-western-empires.html) after the death of the Roman emperor Theodosius I. He was succeeded by his two sons, Honorius, who took the Western Roman Empire, and Arcadius, who took the Eastern Roman Empire.

## Western Roman Collapse

In 476 CE [the Western Roman Empire fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) to Odovacar, the Germanic King. This event traditionally marks [the end of the Western Roman Empire](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Romulus_Augustus.htm). Odavacar sent the western imperial regalia, including the crown, scepter, and orb, to Constantinople. This was the capital of the rival Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. This act served as an acknowledgement to the supremacy of the Eastern Emperor.

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms and other successor states. These included the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain.

## Fall of the Heruli

In 476 CE, the Heruli, led by [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer), deposed the last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus. This event marked the transition from imperial rule to a fragmented Europe. However, the Heruli did not remain in power long. They were defeated and displaced by the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) in 493 CE.

This fall of the Heruli, alongside the Vandals and Ostrogoths, is often viewed through the lens of biblical prophecy. These three Germanic nations were among the most prominent Arian kingdoms that opposed the religious influence of the growing Roman Church.

> "I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots." — Daniel 7:8 (ESV)

The prophecy further elaborates on this event:

> "As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings." — Daniel 7:24 (ESV)

## Decline of Arianism

Arianism was a theological belief that denied the full divinity of Jesus Christ. It asserted instead that He was a created being. This view was widely held by many Germanic tribes but was ultimately suppressed by Nicene Christianity.

In 507, the [Visigoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigoths) were defeated by the Franks under Clovis I. They were defeated in the Battle of Vouillé.

In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals), an Arian Germanic tribe, were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War. Their remnants were dispersed. They ceased to function as a cohesive Arian nation.

In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire.

In 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards) adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

No Arian nations survived as distinct political entities. However, [Arianism persisted among certain Germanic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism).

## Historical Perspectives

The term "Dark Ages" is often criticized by modern historians. They argue that it implies a period of complete intellectual and cultural stagnation. However, many scholars now prefer the term "Early Middle Ages." They point out that this was a time of dynamic social change and the beginning of many modern European nations.

Similarly, the year 476 CE is traditionally cited as the fall of the Roman Empire. Some argue that this only applies to the Western half. The Eastern Roman Empire continued to flourish as the Byzantine Empire for nearly another thousand years. These different viewpoints suggest that the transition was a gradual process rather than a single catastrophic event.

## Conclusion

The Dark Ages began with the final [division of the Roman Empire](#roman-empire-division) in 395 CE. This was followed by the [collapse of the Western Roman Empire](#western-roman-collapse) in 476 CE. The subsequent [fall of the Heruli](#fall-of-the-heruli) and other Arian nations marked the end of a major theological and political era. This transition ultimately led to the [decline of Arianism](#decline-of-arianism) and the consolidation of Nicene Christianity across Europe. While the period is complex, [historical perspectives](#historical-perspectives) help us understand it as a time of significant transformation.
