# The Dark Ages

The period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire is often shrouded in mystery and debate. Commonly known as the "Dark Ages," this era saw the fragmentation of a once-mighty empire into a mosaic of Germanic kingdoms. As these new powers rose and fell, they also navigated a complex religious landscape, eventually leading to the decline of Arianism and the consolidation of Nicene Christianity.

## Imperial Split

In 395 CE, the [Roman Empire split into two separate states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Roman_Empire) after the death of Emperor Theodosius I. His two sons, Honorius and Arcadius, succeeded him, ruling the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire, respectively. This division was a pivotal moment that highlighted the growing regional differences and administrative challenges of the vast Roman territories.

Some view this fragmentation as a fulfillment of the prophecy in Daniel 2:41-43 (ESV), which describes a kingdom that becomes divided and partly strong and partly brittle.

## Fall of the West

The year 476 CE traditionally marks the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus) when [Romulus Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustus) was deposed by Odovacar, a Germanic leader. In a symbolic act of submission, Odovacar sent the imperial regalia to Constantinople. These items included the crown and scepter. This gesture acknowledged the supremacy of the Eastern Roman Emperor and signified that a separate Western Emperor was no longer necessary.

Following this collapse, the Western territories fragmented into various Germanic kingdoms. These included the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy and the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain, which struggled to maintain order in the wake of imperial authority.

## Decline of Arianism

As the Western Roman Empire disintegrated, several Germanic tribes that had adopted [Arianism](337-arianism.md) established their own kingdoms. Arianism was a theological doctrine that challenged the divinity of Christ as defined by the [Nicene Creed](325-nicaea-creed.md). Over time, these Arian nations were either militarily defeated or voluntarily converted to Nicene orthodoxy.

The fall of three specific Arian kingdoms is often noted in historical and theological contexts:

1. **The Heruli:** In 493, the [Heruli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heruli) kingdom in Italy was destroyed by the Ostrogoths under Theodoric the Great, who acted with the support of the Eastern Roman Empire.
2. **The Vandals:** In 534, the [Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalic_War) were militarily defeated by the Byzantine Empire during the Vandalic War.
3. **The Ostrogoths:** In 553, the [Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_War_(535%E2%80%93554)) were defeated by the Byzantine Empire after a protracted conflict.

Other Arian groups also transitioned. In 507, the Visigothic Kingdom was defeated by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé, which accelerated their shift toward Nicene Christianity. Later, in 653, the [Lombards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripert_I) officially adopted Nicene orthodoxy under King Aripert I.

Some historical interpretations link the uprooting of the Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths to biblical prophecy.

> I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. — Daniel 7:8 (ESV)

> As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings. — Daniel 7:24 (ESV)

## Historical Perspectives

The term "Dark Ages" was originally popularized by the Italian scholar Petrarch in the 14th century. He used it to describe what he perceived as a decline in Latin literature and culture following the fall of Rome. However, many modern historians argue that the term is misleading. They suggest it overlooks the significant cultural, legal, and social developments that occurred during the Early Middle Ages. While it was a period of transition and often intense conflict, it was also a time when the foundations of modern Europe were being laid.

## Conclusion

The era commonly referred to as the Dark Ages was defined by the [division of the Roman Empire](#imperial-split) and the eventual [collapse of its Western half in 476 CE](#fall-of-the-west). This political vacuum led to the rise of Germanic kingdoms and a significant [decline of Arianism](#decline-of-arianism) in favor of Nicene Christianity. While the term itself remains a subject of [historical debate](#historical-perspectives), the events of this period were crucial in shaping the religious and political landscape of the medieval world.
