# 336 AD (Christmas)

[On 25 December 336 AD the **first recorded instance of Christmas** was celebrated by Christians](https://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/301-600/the-1st-recorded-celebration-of-christmas-11629658.html), the day of the Saturnalia feast which is also the day of the celebration of the birth of the sun deity Sol Invictus. This happens to be also the day of the turning of Winter in the Northern Hemisphere, when the length of the days (time of sunlight) starts to increase daily.
