# Clerical Marriages

The 11th century marked a significant turning point in the history of the Christian church. A movement known as the Gregorian Reform sought to reshape the lives of those in holy orders. Central to this reform was a directive that would change the personal lives of thousands of clergy members. One might wonder what led to such a drastic shift in policy and how it affected the balance of power between the sacred and the secular.

## The 1074 Decree

In 1074, [Pope Gregory VII issued a decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII) against clerical marriages. This action was part of a larger effort to enforce church discipline. The pope aimed to separate the clergy from secular influences that were seen as compromising their spiritual duties. At the time, many priests and bishops were married and had families. The decree sought to end this practice by requiring celibacy for all those in major orders.

The motivation behind this decree was not only spiritual but also practical. The church faced issues with simony, which is the buying and selling of church offices. There were also concerns about church property being passed down to the children of clergy members as inheritance. By enforcing celibacy, the papacy hoped to ensure that church assets remained within the institution. This move also helped to establish the clergy as a distinct social class that was independent of local aristocratic ties.

## Competing Worldviews

The debate over clerical marriage involved competing views on the nature of the priesthood and the role of the church in society. One perspective emphasized the need for a clergy that was entirely dedicated to the service of God. Proponents of this view argued that marriage and family life created divided loyalties. They believed that a celibate life allowed a priest to focus more fully on his pastoral responsibilities.

Another perspective pointed to the long history of married clergy in the church. Many argued that marriage was an honorable state and that a married man could still be a faithful servant of the church. They saw the new decree as an innovation that went against established traditions. This viewpoint often highlighted the practical difficulties and the personal toll that the enforcement of celibacy took on clergy families.

## Scriptural Perspectives

Both sides of the debate sought support from the scriptures to justify their positions. Those who favored clerical celibacy often pointed to the words of Jesus and the writings of the Apostle Paul.

> For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it. — Matthew 19:12 (ESV)

The Apostle Paul also spoke about the benefits of singleness for those serving the Lord.

> I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided. — 1 Corinthians 7:32-33 (ESV)

Conversely, those who defended clerical marriage referred to the qualifications for church leadership mentioned in the New Testament letters.

> Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, — 1 Timothy 3:2 (ESV)

Similarly, the letter to Titus mentions the requirements for elders.

> if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. — Titus 1:6 (ESV)
