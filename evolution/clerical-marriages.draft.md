# Clerical Marriages

For many centuries in the early church, it was common for priests and even bishops to be married. This practice began to change significantly during the Middle Ages. A major turning point occurred in the 11th century when the papacy initiated a series of reforms. These changes aimed to redefine the lifestyle of the clergy and their relationship with secular society.

## The Gregorian Reform

The Gregorian Reform was a movement led by Pope Gregory VII in the late 11th century. This movement sought to improve the moral integrity of the clergy. It also aimed to establish the independence of the church from the control of kings and lords. [Historical accounts of the Gregorian Reform](https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gregorian-reform) show that it was a frontal attack on secular control over church property. Before these reforms, secular rulers often appointed church officials. This practice led to many problems, including the sale of church offices, which is known as simony.

## The 1074 Decree

In 1074, [Pope Gregory VII issued a decree](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Gregory-VII) against clerical marriages. This decree was part of a larger effort to enforce celibacy among the clergy in the Latin Church. The Pope forbade any priest who was married or living with a woman from performing the mass. He also instructed the laity not to attend services conducted by such priests. This was a bold move that aimed to make [clerical celibacy](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03481a.htm) a universal requirement for the priesthood.

## Reasons for the Change

The church had several reasons for enforcing celibacy. One major concern was the inheritance of church property. When priests had children, they often tried to pass church lands and wealth to their heirs. This weakened the financial stability and independence of the church. By requiring celibacy, the church ensured that its assets remained within the institution. Another reason was the desire for clergy to have undivided devotion to their ministry. Some historians argue that these changes were purely about power and wealth. However, contemporary documents emphasize a genuine concern for the spiritual status of priests and the need for a clergy that was not compromised by secular obligations.

## Resistance and Impact

The enforcement of celibacy met with significant resistance across Europe. Many priests were already married and had families. They argued that the new rules were contrary to tradition and scripture. In some cases, the decree led to tragic consequences for the wives and children of the clergy. Some wives were abandoned or even sold into slavery. Despite the pushback, the papacy continued to press for the reform over several centuries.

## Scriptural Perspectives

Different groups used various scriptures to support their views on clerical marriage. Those who supported celibacy often pointed to the words of Jesus about those who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

> For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it. — Matthew 19:12 (ESV)

They also cited Paul's advice that an unmarried man can focus more on the things of the Lord.

> I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. — 1 Corinthians 7:32 (ESV)

Conversely, those who opposed mandatory celibacy referred to other passages. For example, 1 Timothy 3:2 states that an overseer must be the husband of one wife.

> Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach. — 1 Timothy 3:2 (ESV)

They also pointed to 1 Timothy 4:1-3, which warns against those who forbid marriage.

> Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. — 1 Timothy 4:1-3 (ESV)

## Differing Viewpoints

The issue of clerical marriage highlights two competing worldviews within the history of the church. One view emphasizes the spiritual purity and administrative benefits of a celibate priesthood. This perspective argues that celibacy allows the clergy to serve as a distinct and holy group within society. The other view emphasizes the importance of family life and the scriptural precedents for married clergy. This perspective suggests that marriage can provide a stable and relatable foundation for ministry.

Critiques often argue that mandatory celibacy is unnatural or leads to other moral failures. In response, proponents argue that celibacy is a gift and that any problems are due to individual failures rather than the state of celibacy itself. They also maintain that the institutional benefits were necessary to preserve the church's mission during a chaotic time.
