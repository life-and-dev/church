# Clerical Marriages

For centuries, the marital status of the clergy was a topic of significant debate and varying practice within the Christian church. While many early leaders were married, a pivotal shift occurred in the 11th century that would redefine the priesthood. One of the most influential moments in this transition was the decree issued by Pope Gregory VII in 1074. This move was not merely about personal conduct but was part of a broader effort to reform the entire church structure.

## The 1074 Decree
In 1074, [Pope Gregory VII issued a decree](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/g7-reform1.asp) at a council in Rome against clerical marriages. The mandate forbade any priest who was married or cohabiting with a woman from performing the liturgy or any other clerical duties. This was a bold step in enforcing clerical celibacy, which had been encouraged but often ignored in many regions.

To ensure compliance, Gregory VII took the unusual step of appealing directly to the laity. He instructed the people to refuse the ministrations of any priest who disobeyed the decree. By doing so, he used social pressure and public shame as tools for ecclesiastical reform.

## Reasons for the Reform
The motivations behind this decree were both spiritual and practical. Spiritually, there was a growing emphasis on the purity of the clergy. The belief was that a celibate priest could more fully dedicate himself to the things of the Lord.

Practically, the church sought to separate the clergy from secular influences and interests. Married priests often sought to pass on church property and positions to their children. This practice led to the loss of church land to private families and complications with the feudal system. By enforcing celibacy, Gregory VII aimed to ensure that the church resources remained under its own control. This also ensured that the primary loyalty of the clergy was to the institution rather than their own kin.

## Scriptural Perspectives
The debate over clerical marriage often centers on different interpretations of the Bible. Those who support the practice of married clergy often point to the qualifications for leadership mentioned by the apostle Paul.

> Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, — 1 Timothy 3:2 (ESV)

Furthermore, Paul questioned his own right to take a wife as the other apostles did.

> Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? — 1 Corinthians 9:5 (ESV)

On the other hand, proponents of clerical celibacy highlight the benefits of being unmarried in service to God. Jesus spoke of those who choose to remain single for the sake of His kingdom.

> For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it. — Matthew 19:12 (ESV)

Paul also noted that remaining single allows for a more focused devotion to the ministry.

> The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. — 1 Corinthians 7:32 (ESV)

## Perspectives on the Reform
The decree was not without its critics both then and now. Some historical and modern observers argue that the move was primarily a power grab. They suggest it was intended to consolidate papal authority over local churches and their assets.

However, a defense of the reform suggests it was a necessary step for the integrity of the church. At the time, the church was deeply entangled with the feudal system. This often led to the sale of church offices and the corruption of the clergy. By requiring celibacy, the reforms sought to create a more dedicated and independent priesthood. This helped the church to function as a spiritual institution rather than a series of family estates.
