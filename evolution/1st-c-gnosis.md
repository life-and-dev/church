# 1st Century (Gnosis)

What if the early Christian church wasn't the only interpretation of Jesus' teachings? What if another, more mystical movement existed alongside it, one that saw the material world as a prison and salvation as a secret knowledge? This was the world of the Gnostics, a diverse group of thinkers who challenged the very foundations of what would become mainstream Christianity. This article explores the origins, core beliefs, and the surprising parallels between these two ancient faiths.

## Origins

Acts 8:9-24 possibly refers to [Simon Magus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus) as a Gnostic teacher. Whether he originated [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) is debatable, however from this we can see that Gnosticism was already active when the first Christian gatherings were formed.

Like Christianity, Gnosis also originates from the Middle East.

## Core Gnostic Beliefs

Gnostic philosophy is complex, with many variations, but some common themes include:

*   **Dualism:** A distinction between a good, spiritual world and an evil or flawed material world.
*   **The Divine Spark:** The belief that human souls are divine "sparks" from the spiritual world, trapped in material bodies.
*   **The Demiurge:** The material world was not created by the ultimate, good God, but by a lesser, often ignorant or malevolent being called the demiurge. For some Gnostics, this was the God of the Old Testament.
*   **Gnosis (Knowledge):** Salvation is achieved not through faith or good works, but through "gnosis," or secret knowledge, which awakens the divine spark and allows it to return to the spiritual world.

These ideas were in sharp contrast to the teachings of the emerging proto-orthodox Christian church, which condemned them as "heresy."

## Potential Influence on Christianity

While fundamentally different, some Gnostic concepts have parallels in Christian thought. It is a subject of scholarly debate whether these represent direct influence or coincidental development. The following table highlights some of these similarities, while also noting the subtle but important distinctions.

## Conclusion

Some beliefs long accepted in Christian tradition may not come from the Bible but from outside influences like Gnostic ideas. You should test your doctrines against the Bible, trace their origins, and reject teachings that contradicts the inspired [Word of God](https://word.ofgod.info). Do not assume an idea is Christian simply because it is old or widely held by the majority of Christians.
