# The Gnostics

## Introduction

The term "Gnosticism" comes from the Greek word "gnosis," meaning "knowledge." It describes a diverse set of ancient religious ideas that blended elements of Jewish, Christian, and Greek thought. This article explores the core tenets of Gnosticism, how they differ from mainstream Christianity, and how these two belief systems may have influenced each other.

## Core Beliefs

Acts 8:9-24 possibly refers to [Simon Magus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus) as a Gnostic teacher. Whether he originated [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) is debatable, however from this we can see the Gnosticism was already active when the first Christian gatherings was formed.

Like Christianity, Gnosis also originates from the Middle East.

In short gnostic philosophers reason:

*   **Dualism:** Gnostics believe in a sharp division between the spiritual world, which is good, and the material world, which is flawed or evil.
*   **The Divine Realm:** The spiritual world, or "**Pleroma**," is the abode of the supreme, unknowable God. From this God emanate divine beings called **Aeons**.
*   **The Demiurge:** One of these Aeons, the **Demiurge**, created the material world. This lesser god is often identified with the God of the Old Testament.
*   **Humanity's Predicament:** Human souls are divine sparks trapped in the material world. Salvation is achieved through "gnosis"—special, secret knowledge—that allows the soul to escape the material realm and return to the divine.

The original christian church rejected these philosophies as "heresy".

## Gnosticism and Christianity: A Comparison

While Gnosticism and Christianity share some terminology, their core tenets are fundamentally different. The following table highlights some of these differences:

| Gnosticism                                                                     | Christianity                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| There are many aeons within one God.                                           | There are three members within one godhead.              |
| Aeons are emanations of one God.                                               | Members of the godhead are of the same substance of one God.                        |
| Jesus is an Aeon, an emanation of God.                                         | Jesus is a member of the godhead.                                       |
| God resides in the Pleroma.                                                    | God resides in the Heaven.                                |
| The highest aeons may act as a mediators to God.                               | The exalted Son (Jesus), acts as a mediator to God. |
| Only the mediator can bridge the gap between the material and spiritual world. | We need to pray through Jesus, our mediator, to God.                |
| Jesus was sent from the Pleroma to aid humanity.                               | Jesus was sent from Heaven to aid humanity.                        |
| Jesus appeared as a human, but was still an Aeon.                              | Jesus appeared as a human, but was 100% God at the same time.   |
| You need to have enough gnosis (secret knowledge) for salvation.               | Your need to have enough faith for salvation.      |
| The Gnostic cross symbol                                                       | The Christian cross symbol.                               |

## Conclusion

Gnosticism presents a worldview where salvation is achieved through secret knowledge ([see Core Beliefs](#core-beliefs)), and the material world is an illusion created by a lesser god. This stands in contrast to the Christian belief in a single, benevolent creator God and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ ([see Gnosticism and Christianity: A Comparison](#gnosticism-and-christianity-a-comparison)). While the two systems may have influenced each other in their early stages, their fundamental tenets remain distinct.
