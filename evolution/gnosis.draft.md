What if the early Christian church wasn't the only interpretation of Jesus' teachings? What if another, more mystical movement existed alongside it, one that saw the material world as a prison and salvation as a secret knowledge? This was the world of the Gnostics, a diverse group of thinkers who challenged the very foundations of what would become mainstream Christianity. This article explores the origins, core beliefs, and the surprising parallels between these two ancient faiths.

## Origins

Acts 8:9-24 possibly refers to [Simon Magus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus) as a Gnostic teacher. Whether he originated [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) is debatable, however from this we can see that Gnosticism was already active when the first Christian gatherings were formed.

Like Christianity, Gnosis also originates from the Middle East.

## Core Beliefs

In short, gnostic philosophers reason:

*   There is a good spiritual world and an evil or flawed material world.
*   Living beings are emanations (smaller material manifestations) of the same God.
*   Human souls are fallen sparks of the divine (emanations), trapped in the material world created by an evil demiurge (often identified with the God of the Old Testament).

The early Christian church rejected these philosophies as "heresy."

## Parallels with Christian Doctrine

However, some Gnostic ideas could have potentially influenced Christianity. The following table highlights some of these parallels:

| Gnosticism | Christianity |
| --- | --- |
| There are many aeons within one God. | There are three members within one godhead. |
| Aeons are emanations of one God. | Members of the godhead are of the same substance of one God. |
| Jesus is an Aeon, an emanation of God. | Jesus is a member of the godhead. |
| God resides in the Pleroma. | God resides in the Heaven. |
| The highest aeons may act as mediators to God. | The exalted Son (Jesus), acts as a mediator to God. |
| Only the mediator can bridge the gap between the material and spiritual world. | We need to pray through Jesus, our mediator, to God. |
| Jesus was sent from the Pleroma to aid humanity. | Jesus was sent from Heaven to aid humanity. |
| Jesus appeared as a human but was still an Aeon. | Jesus appeared as a human, but was 100% God at the same time. |
| You need to have enough gnosis (secret knowledge) for salvation. | Your need to have enough faith for salvation. |
| The Gnostic cross symbol. | The Christian cross symbol. |

*Note that not all gnostics and christians share the same views. This table only highlights where these religions could have influenced each other's views.*

## Conclusion

Gnosticism presented a significant, alternative spiritual path in the early centuries of the common era. While its [origins](#origins) are debated, its [core beliefs](#core-beliefs) centered on a dualistic worldview and the pursuit of secret knowledge. Despite being labeled a heresy by the early church, Gnosticism shares some intriguing [parallels with Christian doctrine](#parallels-with-christian-doctrine), suggesting a complex and intertwined history.
