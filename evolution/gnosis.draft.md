# The Gnostics

Have you ever wondered about the early competitors to Christianity? This article delves into Gnosticism, a prominent belief system that emerged around the same time and place as Christianity. We will explore its core tenets and how it compares to Christian doctrines.

## Origins

Acts 8:9-24 possibly refers to [Simon Magus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus) as a Gnostic teacher. Whether he originated [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) is debatable, however from this we can see the Gnosticism was already active when [the first Christian gatherings](/kingdom/church/history/christian) was formed.

Like [Christianity](/kingdom/church/history/christian), Gnosis also originates from the Middle East.

## Core Gnostic Beliefs

Gnostic philosophy is complex, with many variations, but some common themes include:

*   **Dualism:** A distinction between a good, spiritual world and an evil or flawed material world.
*   **The Divine Spark:** The belief that human souls are divine "sparks" from the spiritual world, trapped in material bodies.
*   **The Demiurge:** The material world was not created by the ultimate, good God, but by a lesser, often ignorant or malevolent being called the demiurge. For some Gnostics, this was the God of the Old Testament.
*   **Gnosis (Knowledge):** Salvation is achieved not through faith or good works, but through "gnosis," or secret knowledge, which awakens the divine spark and allows it to return to the spiritual world.

These ideas were in sharp contrast to the teachings of the emerging proto-orthodox Christian church, which condemned them as "heresy."

## Similarities and Potential Influence

While fundamentally different, some Gnostic concepts have parallels in Christian thought. It is a subject of scholarly debate whether these represent direct influence or coincidental development. The following table highlights some of these similarities, while also noting the subtle but important distinctions.

| Gnosticism                                                                     | Christianity                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| There are many aeons within one God.                                           | There are three members within one [godhead](/bible/concepts/godhead).              |
| Aeons are emanations of one God.                                               | Members of the godhead are of the same substance of one God.                        |
| Jesus is an Aeon, an emanation of God.                                         | [Jesus](/god/son) is a member of the godhead.                                       |
| God resides in the Pleroma.                                                    | God resides in the [Heaven](/bible/concepts/heaven).                                |
| The highest aeons may act as a mediators to God.                               | [The exalted Son (Jesus)](/god/son/essence/as-god/lord), acts as a mediator to God. |
| Only the mediator can bridge the gap between the material and spiritual world. | [We need to pray through Jesus](/life/prayer), our mediator, to God.                |
| Jesus was sent from the Pleroma to aid humanity.                               | Jesus was sent [from Heaven](/bible/idioms) to aid humanity.                        |
| Jesus appeared as a human, but was still an Aeon (a spiritual being).          | [Jesus appeared as a human](/god/son/essence), but was fully God and fully man.     |
| Salvation requires enough *gnosis* (secret knowledge).                         | Some traditions emphasize that salvation requires "enough [faith](/life/faith)".     |
| The Gnostic cross symbol was an important emblem.                              | [The Christian cross symbol](/bible/symbolism/cross) is a central emblem.           |

*Note that not all gnostics and christians share the same views. This table only highlights where these religions could have influenced each other's views.*

## Contrasts with Mainstream Christianity

While Gnosticism and early Christianity coexisted and sometimes used similar language, their core tenets were fundamentally opposed, leading the [proto-orthodox church to condemn Gnosticism as heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Relation_with_early_Christianity). These differences created starkly different worldviews with varying societal implications.

| Aspect | Gnosticism | Mainstream Christianity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nature of God** | The [ultimate God is remote, unknowable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Monad), and entirely separate from the flawed material world. A lesser, ignorant, or malevolent being (the [demiurge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge)) created the universe. | God is a personal, loving creator who is actively involved in His creation. He is both transcendent and immanent. ([Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=ESV), [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=ESV)) |
| **Creation** | The [material world is seen as a prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Cosmology), inherently flawed or evil, created as a mistake by the demiurge. | Creation is inherently good, a deliberate act of God. The world is fallen due to human sin, but it is not intrinsically evil. ([Genesis 1:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A31&version=ESV)) |
| **Salvation** | Salvation is achieved by a select few through [*gnosis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosis)—a secret, esoteric knowledge that awakens the divine spark within, allowing the soul to escape the material prison. It is a path of self-liberation. | Salvation is a gift from God, open to all through faith in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is not earned through secret knowledge but received through grace. ([Ephesians 2:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=ESV)) |
| **Jesus Christ** | Christ is often viewed as a purely spiritual being or an emissary of the high God who only appeared to be human (a belief known as [docetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism)). His purpose was to impart gnosis. | Jesus Christ was a real human being, the Word made flesh. His physical suffering and bodily resurrection are central to salvation. ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&version=ESV)) |
| **Societal View**| Tended towards [asceticism and withdrawal from the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Moral_and_ritual_practice), which was seen as an evil trap. Engagement in society, family, and procreation was often viewed negatively as it perpetuated entrapment in the material world. | Teaches believers to be "in the world, but not of the world," engaging with and serving society as "salt and light." Affirms marriage, family, and stewardship of the created world. ([Matthew 5:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A13-16&version=ESV)) |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while Gnosticism and Christianity share some historical roots and vocabulary, they represent two distinct worldviews. Gnosticism emphasizes a dualistic universe and [salvation through secret knowledge](#core-gnostic-beliefs), while mainstream Christianity, grounded in the Bible, focuses on a single, benevolent Creator and [salvation through faith](#contrasts-with-mainstream-christianity).

It is possible that some later Christian traditions and folk beliefs were influenced by Gnostic ideas, but this is a topic of ongoing scholarly discussion. The core tenets of biblical Christianity remain fundamentally distinct from the Gnostic worldview.
