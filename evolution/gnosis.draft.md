# The Gnostics

Have you ever wondered about the early competitors to Christianity? This article delves into Gnosticism, a prominent belief system that emerged around the same time and place as Christianity. We will explore its core tenets and how it compares to Christian doctrines.

## Origins

Acts 8:9-24 possibly refers to [Simon Magus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Magus) as a Gnostic teacher. Whether he originated [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) is debatable, however from this we can see the Gnosticism was already active when [the first Christian gatherings](/kingdom/church/history/christian) was formed.

Like [Christianity](/kingdom/church/history/christian), Gnosis also originates from the Middle East.

## Core Beliefs

In short gnostic philosophers reason:

* There is a good spiritual world and an evil or flawed material world
* Living beings are emanations (smaller material manifestation) of the same God
* Human souls are fallen sparks of divine (emanations), trapped in the material world created by the evil demiurge (the God of the Old Testament)

The original christian church rejected these philosophies as "heresy".

## Gnosticism and Christianity

While some Gnostic ideas may seem similar to Christian beliefs, their core tenets are fundamentally different. The following table highlights some of these differences and potential areas of influence.

| Gnosticism                                                                     | Christianity                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| There are many aeons within one God.                                           | There are three members within one [godhead](/bible/concepts/godhead).              |
| Aeons are emanations of one God.                                               | Members of the godhead are of the same substance of one God.                        |
| Jesus is an Aeon, an emanation of God.                                         | [Jesus](/god/son) is a member of the godhead.                                       |
| God resides in the Pleroma.                                                    | God resides in the [Heaven](/bible/concepts/heaven).                                |
| The highest aeons may act as a mediators to God.                               | [The exalted Son (Jesus)](/god/son/essence/as-god/lord), acts as a mediator to God. |
| Only the mediator can bridge the gap between the material and spiritual world. | [We need to pray through Jesus](/life/prayer), our mediator, to God.                |
| Jesus was sent from the Pleroma to aid humanity.                               | Jesus was sent [from Heaven](/bible/idioms) to aid humanity.                        | 
| Jesus appeared as a human, but was still an Aeon.                              | [Jesus appeared as a human](/god/son/essence), but was 100% God at the same time.   |
| Salvation is achieved through gnosis (secret knowledge).                       | Salvation is achieved through [faith](/life/faith) in [Jesus Christ](/eternal/saved).|

*Note that not all gnostics and christians share the same views. This table only highlights where these religions could have influenced each other's views.*

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while Gnosticism and Christianity share some historical roots and vocabulary, they represent two distinct worldviews. Gnosticism emphasizes a dualistic universe and [salvation through secret knowledge](#core-beliefs), while Christianity focuses on a single, benevolent God and [salvation through faith](#gnosticism-and-christianity) in Jesus Christ.
