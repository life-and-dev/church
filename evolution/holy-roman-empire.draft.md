# The Rise of the Holy Roman Empire

The emergence of the Holy Roman Empire marked a pivotal shift in European history, blending secular power with religious authority. As the Western Roman Empire faded into the past, a new order began to take shape under the guidance of the Frankish kings and the Roman papacy. This union would redefine the political landscape of Europe for centuries, raising questions about the balance of power between Church and State.

## Alliance with the Frankish Kingdom

In 756, Pope Stephen II sought a new protector for the Roman Church. He allied with the Frankish King, Pippin the Short, to [gain independence from the Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Pepin). This alliance resulted in the Donation of Pepin, which provided a legal basis for the Papal States. By turning away from the Eastern Empire, the papacy secured its own temporal authority and established a close relationship with the rising Carolingian dynasty.

## The Coronation of Charlemagne

The partnership between the papacy and the Franks reached its climax on 25 December 800. On that day, [the pope crowned Charlemagne, King of the Franks as emperor](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/the-coronation-of-800-ce/) of the Holy Roman Empire at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The goal was to reunite various regions of the [former Western Roman Empire](./dark-ages.draft.md) under a common rule. Historical accounts, such as those by his biographer Einhard, suggest that Charlemagne may have been surprised by the coronation. However, many historians argue that this reluctance might have been a calculated political maneuver. By appearing surprised, he could avoid immediate diplomatic tension with the Byzantine Empire while still embracing the power and prestige that the title provided. Regardless of his initial reaction, he quickly utilized the imperial status to consolidate his power and claim himself as the legitimate successor to the Roman emperors.

## Significance and Impact

The Holy Roman Empire remained a dominant force in Europe until its dissolution in 1806. [This institution was significant](https://www.medievalists.net/2010/12/the-significance-of-the-coronation-of-charlemagne/) for several reasons. First, it set a lasting precedent for papal involvement in imperial politics. This involvement significantly strengthened the power and influence of the Roman Catholic Church over secular rulers. Second, the empire worked to suppress any religious practices that went against the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. Finally, the imperial authority helped to spread Roman Catholic Christianity across the European continent. This expansion was often justified by the biblical mandate that "there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God" (Romans 13:1 (ESV)). Furthermore, the ideal of a unified Christian empire drew upon the vision that "the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed" (Daniel 2:44 (ESV)).

## Conclusion
