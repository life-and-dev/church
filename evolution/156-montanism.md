# 156 (Montanism)

In the 2nd century, a controversial movement known as Montanism emerged, challenging the early Christian church with claims of new, divine revelations. This movement, founded by a man named Montanus and two prophetesses, Prisca and Maximilla, questioned the finality of apostolic teaching and introduced a set of rigorous moral and ascetic demands. What was it about Montanism that both attracted followers and drew condemnation from the wider church?

## The Rise of the New Prophecy

In 156 AD, [Montanus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Montanus-religious-leader) converted to Christianity in Ardabau, a small village in [Phrygia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Phrygia) in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) (modern Turkey). He fell into a trance and began to "prophesy under the influence of the Spirit" and was soon joined by two young women, Prisca (or Priscilla), and Maximilla, who also began to prophesy. They called themselves, "the Three". Montanus claimed to be [the embodiment of the "Spirit of the Truth"](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html) and claimed that Jesus continued to give him new and more advanced revelations which the church had to accept. This was considered heretical by the mainstream Christian Church of that time.

## Key Teachings

[Montanism taught](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism):
* **Legalistic moral rigorism**: The Montanists did indeed emphasize strict adherence to moral codes and taught that Christians should strive for a higher level of spiritual perfection.
* **Lengthened fasting times**: They advocated for longer periods of fasting, which was seen as a way to mortify the flesh and demonstrate devotion to God.
* **Forbidding flight from martyrdom**: [The Montanists forbade fleeing from persecution](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm), believing that [Christians should accept martyrdom](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/why-were-the-montanists-condemned/) rather than escape. [Flight from persecution was considered unlawful](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html), contrasting with orthodox teaching that permitted flight (Matthew 10:23).
* **Discouraging marriage**: Some Montanist leaders taught that married life was not essential to Christian living, which led to a rejection of marriage and family life by some of their adherents.
* **Prohibition on second marriages**: The Montanists also prohibited remarriage after the death of one's spouse or divorce, believing that this helped to maintain purity of heart and dedication to God.

## A Call to a Higher Standard

The teachings of Montanism presented a vision of the Christian faith that was intensely devout and uncompromising. By emphasizing strict moral and ethical standards, the movement sought to create a community of believers who were set apart from the world, ready to embrace martyrdom rather than compromise their faith. This call to a higher standard, while divisive, resonated with those who felt the church was becoming too lenient and worldly.

## Lasting Impact and Legacy

Although [Montanism gradually disappeared between the 5th and 9th centuries](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism) and the church rejected these teachings, it still influenced the Christian church's theology, apostolic traditions, authoritative roles and encouraged the church to canonise bible scriptures to define clear boundaries between "divine revelation" and "heretical movements". The movement's emphasis on the Holy Spirit's continuing work and its call for a higher standard of Christian living left a lasting mark on the church, prompting it to formalize its doctrines and canon of scripture.

## Conclusion

Montanism, with its [bold claims of new prophecy](#the-rise-of-the-new-prophecy) and [demanding ethical standards](#a-call-to-a-higher-standard), represented a significant challenge to the early church. While ultimately condemned as heretical, its [legacy can be seen in the church's subsequent development](#lasting-impact-and-legacy) of a more defined theological and canonical framework. The story of Montanism serves as a compelling reminder of the tensions that have shaped Christian history—between divine revelation and established doctrine, and between the call to spiritual perfection and the realities of human life.
