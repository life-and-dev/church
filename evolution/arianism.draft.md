# The spread of Arianism

Arianism, a doctrine that challenged the divinity of Christ, didn't fade away after the Council of Nicaea. This article explores how key figures and political currents in the 4th century Roman Empire contributed to its surprising resilience and spread.

## Constantius II

In 337 [Constantius II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_II), the third son of Constantine became emperor over Greece, Thrace, the Asian provinces, and Egypt in the east, while his brothers reigned the other parts of the Roman Empire.

Constantius actively promoted Arianism, convening councils such as Sirmium (347-375) and Constantinople (360) to enforce creeds favorable to this doctrine. While he banned pagan sacrifices and ordered the closure of temples, he permitted some pagan institutions, like the Vestal Virgins, to continue.

Constantius also enacted laws that limited Jewish slave ownership and prohibited interfaith marriages between Jews and Christians.

## Bishop Ulfilas

Ulfilas, a Goth raised in a Cappadocian Christian family, was [consecrated as an Arian bishop by Eusebius of Nicomedia in 341](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/biography/ulfilas). He [translated the Bible into Gothic](https://paganheim.com/blogs/culture-religion/the-rise-and-spread-of-arian-christianity-among-the-goths), creating an alphabet.

Constantius policies made it possible for [Ulfilas to spread Arianism among the Goths](https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/roman-catholic-and-orthodox-churches-general-biographies/ulfilas) (Visigoths and Ostrogoths), distinguishing them from Nicene Christians in the Roman Empire.

## Conclusion

In summary, the spread of Arianism was significantly propelled by the imperial patronage of emperors like [Constantius II](#constantius-ii) and the missionary work of figures such as [Bishop Ulfilas](#bishop-ulfilas). Their actions ensured Arianism's influence extended far beyond the theological debates of the early church, particularly among the Gothic tribes.
