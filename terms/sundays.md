# The Lord's Day

"The Lord's Day" is commonly understood by Christians to be Sunday, the first day of the week, commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ (Mark 16:9).

## Institution

1. On 7 March 321, [Constantine decreed "DIES SOLIS"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Invictus) which means *"the day of the Sun"*, known today as "Sunday" – as the Roman day of rest: "On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed." Constantine did this because he worshipped Sol Invictus (the sun god).
2. In 363/364 that the council of Laodicea made an effort to suppress Judaism and declared a church decree (still held by most modern Christian churches today) that the Christian church should observe Sunday's as a day of rest instead of the Sabbath. They went even so far to persecute those who "idle on the Sabbath". 
3. This caused many Christians to move their day of rest to Sundays to avoid persecution. 

Today, Christians still observe Sundays.

## The Purpose

Christians set this day aside to rest from labour with the purpose to attend to [church](https://church.ofgod.info) sermons and worship services. 

Technically gatherings can be held any day of the week, but it practically make sense to do it on a day of less economic activities.

The Bible instructs that the purpose of the Sabbath is:

1. > "It is a sign... in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth..." -- Exodus 31:17 (NKJV)
2. A day set aside to rest from labour (Exodus 23:12, 31:13-17) with the purpose to
   * "assemble to the LORD" in "your dwellings" *(i.e. "tents"/"houses" as people did not "dwell" in the Holy Temple and churches did not exist yet)* (Leviticus 23:3) 

However, there were certain special feasts (ceremonies) which were dedicated to special public gatherings at the temple to worship God with special sacrifices. All these feasts were declared Sabbaths to free the Israelites from their labour so that they could attend to these feasts. These feasts were not the weekly Sunday Church services, but special events.

Therefore, the fact that the apostles sometimes gathered on Sundays serve no prove that the Sabbath has changed to Sundays. For example:

### The Apostles gathered on Sundays

Acts 20:7 made it clear that the first "church" was on the "first day" (Sunday).

However, this was never a Sabbatical requirement. There are many examples through scriptures where people "break the bread" (a special form of fellowship in God's presence) on no specific day of the week. The "break the bread" has nothing to do with Sabbath rest.

### Paul's church gathered on Sundays

According to 1 Corinthians 16:2-3, Paul's church gathered on the "first day" (Sunday). 

The assumption is that Paul's church gathered on Sundays because that is when the financial collection took place. However, this might not necessarily be the case. But even if they did gather on a Sunday for whatever reason, it still proofs nothing. Christians can gather any day they want without violating any laws.

## Resting Law

### The Fulfillment of the Sabbath

Christians believe that Jesus changed the Sabbath to "The Lord's Day". They interpret Matthew 5:17 that Jesus fulfilled (deprecated) the laws and that is not longer necessary to keep the Sabbath. 

However, many confuse the Torah (Pentateuch) translated as "laws" with God's commands because of the way modern bibles are translated. "[The *Laws*](https://biblehub.com/greek/3551.htm) and the *Prophets*" are the names of the books (or scrolls) which contained [prophecies of the Messiah](https://prophecies.ofgod.info/messianic) which Jesus came to fulfill. He did not say that he came to "abolish the laws".  Instead Jesus fulfilled the prophecies regarding himself and actually requested his disciples to keep the teachings (or "laws").

The Sabbath was not a temporary idea, but should be observed forever through all generations (Exodus 31:16-17).

### Jesus replaced the Sabbath

Christians interpret that Matthew 11:28-30 means that Jesus will give rest to those who follow him. Therefore the original Sabbath is redundant.

However, this scripture is often quoted out of context. The context is that Jesus was talking about failed attempts to convert people in cities who rejected his message. He asked his disciples to rather go to other cities and that they should not take these rejections and failed attempts personally. Therefore, he urged them to only accept his "yoke" of obedience to God which will give them rest from the burden of accomplishment. This has nothing to do with the Sabbath.

### Jesus did not keep the Sabbath

> The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath. -- Mark 2:27-28 (ESV)

Christians understood that this mean that Jesus ruled that Sabbath keeping is deprecated. In addition they also quote Matthew 12:11-12; Luke 6:6-9; Luke 13:10-17; John 5:1-18 which prove that Jesus "laboured" on the Sabbath by healing people.

However, the definition of "labour" is misunderstood. That was also the point Jesus made to the Pharisees (Mark 2:24-28). Both parties agreed that it is wrong to labour on a Sabbath. They differ on what "labour" means.

### The Apostles ruled that Sabbath keeping is not required

After much debate the Apostles ruled:

> For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: that you abstain from 
> 1. what has been sacrificed to idols, and 
> 2. from blood, and 
> 3. from what has been strangled, and 
> 4. from sexual immorality. 
>
> If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell. -- Acts 15:28-29 (ESV)

Therefore, Christians interpret that these are the only commandments that Christians should keep.

However, the apostles were not rewriting the Bible. Instead the issue they addressed was who was acceptable to the congregation. Should the new converts first get circumcised or not? (Acts 15:1-2)

The final rulling was to accept everyone as they are, except those who refust to abstrain from the list mentioned above. They did not provide reasons, what one could assume that for their own safety it would make sense to avoid idolaters, cannibals and adulters in the congregation. This list is by no means a complete list of laws that replaced God's Own commandments.

### Judgement on those who keep Sabbath

#### Colossians 2:16-17

Depending on your bible translation it may either read:

* Christians should not allow Jews to judge them for not keeping the Sabbath; or
* Believers should continue to observe the Sabbath, despite judgement

#### Hebrews 4:9-10

Scholars have different opinions on what "a Sabbath-rest for the people of God" means. To some it means:

* means Jesus has superseded the original commandment to observe the Sabbath
* the Sabbath observance should continue

#### Romans 14:5-6

Christians often interpret Romans 14:5-6 that Paul judged those who kept the Sabbath.

However, Romans 14:1-23 were addressing the issue that new believers were judged for not keeping Jewish traditions. 

> As for the one who is **weak in faith**, welcome him, but **not to quarrel over opinions**. -- Romans 14:1 (ESV)

Paul was not negating the Sabbath, instead he addressed a specific issue in regard to having grace with new converts. He requested that the new converts should be accepted in love even with their flaws because the Lord should judge them instead.

## Sunday Keeping

According to Revelation 1:10, John of Patmos received his revelation from God on "the Lord's Day" (Sunday).

However, this is by no means any good reason by itself to change the Sabbath to Sundays. Therefore, we need to investigate the matter further.

### Choosing A Resting Day

Some argue that is just make sense to rather rest on Sundays, because economically the whole world slows down on Sundays. Some shops closes earlier or does not open at all, most offices and factories are closed on Sundays, labour, call-outs and services often cost more on Sundays, etc. Therefore, some reason they can choose any day they want to rest as long as they rest at least every seventh day. Because it is far easier to rest on Sundays in alignment with the rest of the world, it makes Sundays an obvious choice.

However, God's commands were very clear and specific that God instructed that specifically **the** seventh day of the week should be observed for rest (Exodus 20:8). Days used to be identified by their numerical order instead of a name. The "seventh day" would mean "Saturday" in modern English terms. Only centuries after the Bible was written, the Greeks and later the Romans as well, [named the days of the weeks after their gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_days_of_the_week). For example:

| Numerical Value | English   | Latin         | Name of god                                           |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1               | Sunday    | dies Solis    | Sol Invictus, the sun god                             |
| 2               | Monday    | dies Lunae    | Moon god                                              |
| 3               | Tuesday   | dies Martis   | Mars, the Roman god of war                            |
| 4               | Wednesday | dies Mercurii | Woden, the Germanic god / Mercury, the Roman god      |
| 5               | Thursday  | dies Jovis    | Thor, the Germanic god of thunder                     |
| 6               | Friday    | dies Veneris  | Frigg, the Germanic goddess / Venus the Roman goddess |
| 7               | Saturday  | dies Saturn   | Saturn, the Roman god                                 |

Not whichever day feels good to rest. Sabbath keeping is not simply a good idea. It was considered a very serious matter by the Ancient Israelites who could receive received death penalty for violating this law (Exodus 31:14-15, 35:2).

If Christians simply comply with the pressure of the world to rest on the Sunday instead, then "the Sabbath" won't be "a sign" (Exodus 31:17).

## Sabbath Keeping

### Inspired Word of God

> And **God spoke all these words**, saying, ...
>
> “**Remember the Sabbath day**, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it **you shall not do any work**, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. **For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day.** Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. -- Exodus 20:1,8-11 (ESV)

In Moses also made it clear this is an important command in Exodus 23:12, 31:13-17; Deuteronomy 5:12-15; Leviticus 23:3 as well as by the major prophets Isaiah 58:13-14 and Jeremiah 17:21-22.

Christians often argue that this is a Jewish law or tradition not applicable to other nations. However, in the very same "word" from God Himself, He provided a reason which points to the creation.

### Applies to All People

> And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then **God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it**, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. -- Genesis 2:2-3 (NKJV)

At that time there were no Jewish nation yet. This proves that God sanctified the seventh day to all people.

## Conclusion

1. God Himself kept the Sabbath (Genesis 2:2-3).
2. God declared it a permanent sign of a covenant throughout all generations (Exodus 31:16-17). 
3. God repeated confirmed the Sabbath commandment multiple times throughout the Old Testament via different prophets (Isaiah 58:13-14; Jeremiah 17:21-22).
