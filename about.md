# About the author

My journey with faith has been anything but conventional. From atheism to exploring various Christian traditions including megachurches to house churches with envolvement in various traditional protestants, charismatic and messianic congregations. I've spent years asking questions about God, the Bible, and what it truly means to follow Christ.

## A Shared Journey of Discovery

Throughout this journey, I've become increasingly fascinated by what the Bible teaches about the body of Christ.

This website is the fruit of that ongoing exploration. I'm still learning, still discovering new depths in familiar passages, and still amazed by how much there is to understand about [our Father God](https://ofgod.info) and His [son](https://son.ofgod.info) Jesus who is the Christ and our Lord.

This website exists to help Christians discover their full inheritance and calling in Christ. While churches and Christian institutions may play important roles in our spiritual lives, they can sometimes unintentionally limit our understanding of what God has made available to us. My goal is to explore the fullness of what the [Word of God](https://word.ofgod.info) reveals about our identity, authority, and destiny in the body of Christ and to empower believers to reach their full potential in the [Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info).

### The Heart Behind This Website

I want to help fellow believers experience the fullness of what God has made available. This website specifically aims to **reveal what the body of Christ truly is** and **what Jesus and the apostles originally intended for the church**. Sometimes religious traditions or institutional frameworks (however well-intentioned) can obscure the radical nature of the gospel and limit what's possible in God's Kingdom. By returning to Scripture, we can rediscover the apostolic vision for Christ's body and our place within it.

You'll find here careful attention to biblical texts, exploration of the early church's practices and teachings, and honest wrestling with questions about what the church was meant to be. Some topics might be unfamiliar. Some interpretations might differ from what you've heard before. That's okay — in fact, rediscovering the original vision often means reconsidering assumptions we've inherited.

### Full Transparency

I write independently, not affiliated with any church or organization, and without sponsorship. This freedom allows me to follow where God's word leads without institutional constraints or the pressure to conform to denominational boundaries. This doesn't diminish the value of church communities but rather, it allows me to serve as a supplementary resource that explores questions and themes that might fall outside traditional teaching frameworks.

I encourage you to critically evaluate everything your read. Not just on this website, but always pray about any Christian content from any source you receive. I admit that I have been [wrong before](disclaimer.md), and I'll likely make more mistakes. That's why I genuinely invite you to [correct my errors](edit.md) when you spot them. Your wisdom, your insights, and your questions make this a richer resource for everyone who visits.

### An Invitation to Explore

Rather than asking you to accept my conclusions, I invite you to examine the Bible for yourself. The content here is designed to point you back to God's word, to raise questions worth pondering, and to provide tools for your own study.

As you explore this site, I encourage you to:
- Test everything against the Scripture (Acts 17:11)
- Ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and discernment
- Engage thoughtfully with ideas that might be new to you
- Share what you discover with others

Whether you attend a traditional church, a house gathering, or worship on your own, my prayer is that this content helps you break through any limitations and discover the abundant life Jesus promised. May it draw you closer to God's love and your position in His eternal Kingdom.

Join me in this journey of discovery, exploring together what it means be part of the body of Christ.
