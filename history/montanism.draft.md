title: Montanism

In 156 AD, [Montanus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Montanus-religious-leader) converted to Christianity in Ardabau, a small village in [Phrygia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Phrygia) in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) (modern Turkey). He fell into a trance and began to "prophesy under the influence of the Spirit" and was soon joined by two young women, Prisca (or Priscilla), and Maximilla, who also began to prophesy. They called themselves, "the Three". Montanus claimed to be [the embodiment of the "Spirit of the Truth"](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html) and claimed that Jesus continued to give him new and more advanced revelations which the church had to accept. This was considered heretical by the mainstream Christian Church of that time.

[Montanism taught](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism):
* Legalistic moral rigorism: The Montanists did indeed emphasise strict adherence to moral codes and taught that Christians should strive for a higher level of spiritual perfection.
* Lengthened fasting times: They advocated for longer periods of fasting, which was seen as a way to mortify the flesh and demonstrate devotion to God.
* Forbidding flight from martyrdom: [The Montanists forbade fleeing from persecution](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm), believing that [Christians should accept martyrdom](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/why-were-the-montanists-condemned/) rather than escape. [Flight from persecution was considered unlawful](https://www.gotquestions.org/montanism.html), contrasting with orthodox teaching that permitted flight (Matthew 10:23).
* Discouraging marriage: Some Montanist leaders taught that married life was not essential to Christian living, which led to a rejection of marriage and family life by some of their adherents.
* Prohibition on second marriages: The Montanists also prohibited remarriage after the death of one's spouse or divorce, believing that this helped to maintain purity of heart and dedication to God.

Although [Montanism gradually disappeared between the 5th and 9th centuries](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Montanism) and the church rejected these teachings, it still [influenced the Christian church's theology](/kingdom/church/history/tertullian), apostolic traditions, authoritative roles and encouraged the church to canonise bible scriptures to define clear boundaries between "divine revelation" and "heretical movements".
