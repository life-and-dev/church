title: The first Christians
---

However, [in the first century the citizens of Antioch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_1st_century) started to call Christ's disciples ["Christians"](/bible/concepts/christian) which means "those who believe in Christ" (Acts 11:26).

There is [scholarly debate](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/75705/who-first-coined-the-term-christian) about whether this term was originally intended as a derogatory label or was simply a descriptive identifier. [Some scholars](https://discover.hubpages.com/religion-philosophy/the-term-christian-initially-was-an-insult) argue it may have carried a derisive element, pointing to Antioch's reputation for creating mocking nicknames. [Others contend](https://www.lavistachurchofchrist.org/cms/was-the-term-christian-originally-a-derogatory-reference/) that the Greek word *chrematisai* used in Acts 11:26 suggests divine origin rather than human mockery, and that the suffix "-ian" was a standard Roman way to indicate allegiance (similar to *Caesariani* for Caesar's soldiers). Regardless of its origins, early Christians embraced the term (1 Peter 4:16), and Christianity became the official name of this new religion.
