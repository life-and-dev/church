## What is the counter of the Kingdom of God?

Inherently all humans have a need of belonging to a community and to have a greater purpose than merely surviving. Sometimes non-religious clubs try to fulfil this need without God. 

Clubs often give their members a purpose, a sense of belonging or recognition and often some sort of security. While clubs are often healthy for social interaction, collaboration, knowledge or resource sharing, it should never be considered the ultimate goal in life as a replacement for the Kingdom of God.

The same could also be said about [churches](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/church). There are many members of the body of Christ that meet in the name of a church as a religious club. Depending on the culture and circumstances it is often more practical to meet in a public place than a private home. 

Some church denomination even claims to be [the body of Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/kingdom/body). While in reality the body of Christ is much bigger than any church. This is evident when spirit filled believers from different places in the world often move in the same direction with prayers or support complementing each other without having physical contact or knowledge of each other.

When any group of people meet, it is natural for a leader to arise and to guide the group such that there is order and collaboration. But this does not mean that the leader owns the group or is more important than the group. It is only a function in "the body" (Ephesians 4:11-12). Jesus warned that leaders should serve the group in humility, instead of claiming special titles (Matthew 23:1-12).
